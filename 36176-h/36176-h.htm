<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>NEW YEAR&rsquo;S EVE</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true! I&rsquo;ve pinched myself
a dozen times. I&rsquo;ve pulled my own hair. I&rsquo;ve
looked at myself in the mirror again and again
and told myself that it is a fact, that I am I, Nan
Sherwood of Tillbury, United States of America
and student of Lakeview Hall, and that I am going
to sail away next spring to Scotland to visit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The end of the sentence was lost in a muffle
as Nan pulled off the simple silk frock she had
been wearing.</p>

<p>Bess Harley, her closest friend since primary
school days, finished it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emberon, the home of your mother&rsquo;s ancestors.&rdquo;
Her voice sounded unusually heavy. Nan
looked around and immediately was all contrition,
for Bess&rsquo;s eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bess, darling, forgive me. I&rsquo;m nothing
but a thoughtless old meany.&rdquo; So saying, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
wiped Bess&rsquo;s tears away and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>Bess caught her lip between her teeth and shook
her head as she fought for self-control. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
an old silly myself,&rdquo; she half apologized. &ldquo;But I
can hardly bear the thought of your going so far
away from all of us for a whole summer. And it&rsquo;s
true you are going, Nan, as true as the fact that
Walter Mason cut in on more than half your
dances tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this jibe, Bess&rsquo; eyes twinkled, and she
felt better.</p>

<p>Nan blushed. &ldquo;Oh, Bess, was it really so bad?
I told him not to, but he said he was under orders
to see that I didn&rsquo;t get into any more scrapes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess laughed. &ldquo;You dear! Of course, it was all
right. We all danced with him&mdash;for a few seconds
at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan looked somewhat unconvinced. Walter,
she felt, was paying her rather special attention
these days and because she did like him, she hardly
knew whether to be pleased or angry. She
succeeded only in being embarrassed.</p>

<p>Now, a knock diverted her thoughts. She
jumped up, but before she could open the door,
two of her other companions at Lakeview Hall
entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May we come in?&rdquo; It was pretty little Grace
Mason speaking. After her followed Rhoda Hammond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
her dark eyes sparkling with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grace, it was such a nice party!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed
enthusiastically as she placed chairs for
the two visitors. &ldquo;Your mother and dad are perfect
peaches to have us all here tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace smiled shyly. &ldquo;It was fun for me, too. Do
you know, I&rsquo;ve never before stayed up to watch
the old year out and the New Year in! It&rsquo;s my first
New Year&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll always remember it, too,&rdquo; Rhoda
chimed in. Then she looked rather sad, for it was
the first time she had ever spent the holiday away
from her pretty blind mother, her dad, and Rose
Ranch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it was curly headed Bess speaking now.
&ldquo;We will. Would you believe it? Tonight when
I stood down there near the big windows, looking
out across the room, and saw you all with
dishes of ice cream in your hands, the clock
chimed out eleven-thirty and I felt as though Mrs.
Cupp should come in, clap her hands, and tell us
all to report to Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s office tomorrow.
That&rsquo;s almost always happened, you know, when
we have had a really good spread at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls laughed merrily. They had pictures
in their minds of everybody at the party dropping
their dishes and scurrying away at the appearance
of Mrs. Cupp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you feel too guilty,&rdquo; Nan looked across at
Bess, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Dr. Beulah when we get back to
Lakeview next Wednesday. Perhaps she can be
persuaded to impose the silent treatment on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan,&rdquo; Bess laughed, &ldquo;Remember the time
she did that to you and I tried so hard to make
you talk. It was so dull having a roommate who
did nothing but shake her head when I opened my
mouth and let out words of wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; Nan tried to keep her
face straight as she made the statement and then
paused before she added&mdash;&ldquo;the words of
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls all laughed. Then there was silence
as each one thought of all the good times they
had had in the past years. It was Grace who spoke
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother will be in before long, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;to tell us that we must go to bed. Nan,
before she does, tell us more about your going
to Europe. Just imagine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Grace,&rdquo; Nan interrupted her friend.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t tell you anything more
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, all the girls looked more questioning
than ever and Rhoda protested, &ldquo;But Nan,
you can&rsquo;t be mysterious about a trip abroad. We
simply couldn&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; This was unusual coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from the generally quiet Rhoda and for a
moment they all looked at her. Her face flushed
slightly. The words sounded strange even to her.
Could she be forgetting those southern manners
that always made her so mindful of others&rsquo; feelings?
Now, as she saw the expression on Nan&rsquo;s
face and then looked at Bess, she guessed at Nan&rsquo;s
reasons for wishing to delay talk of the European
trip. With her usual tact, she changed the subject
entirely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have any of you made any New Year&rsquo;s resolutions?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>Almost as quick as Rhoda to sense the reason
for Nan&rsquo;s unwillingness to talk, Grace answered
the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of a million things I ought to resolve
to do, but it&rsquo;s so discouraging. I never seem
to be able to keep any of my resolutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan smiled her thanks to both of the girls, and
then turned to Bess. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one resolution we
all ought to make,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Bess asked as she tried to guess
what fault they all had in common.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be nicer to Linda Riggs when we go back
to school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicer to Linda Riggs!&rdquo; Bess exploded. &ldquo;Why,
if I make any resolution at all about that girl,
it will be to utterly ignore her when I get back!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Nicer to Linda Riggs! Why, Nan Sherwood, and
after all she has done to you! If I had her here
this minute I&rsquo;d like to slap her snobbish face. Just
because her father happens to own a railroad, she
thinks that she owns the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bess!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed. &ldquo;Be quiet!
There&rsquo;s no point in your talking that way about
her, no matter what she does. If you don&rsquo;t keep
quiet, I&rsquo;ll think you are as bad as she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Bess half admitted. &ldquo;Just the
same, I wish she wasn&rsquo;t coming back to school at
all. I don&rsquo;t think she should be allowed to after
causing that explosion. She might have killed us
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan nodded her head at this last. It was true
that Linda had done a very risky thing in meddling
with the steam valve in the basement of the
school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but even so, I&rsquo;m going to be nicer to her
in the spring term,&rdquo; Nan resolved. &ldquo;Maybe she
has some good qualities we don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan means,&rdquo; Rhoda interpreted, &ldquo;that there
is some good in all of us. Perhaps she is right.
Perhaps Linda has never been given a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess snorted very inelegantly. &ldquo;You can all turn
the other cheek if you want to,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m not going to. She&rsquo;s just a mean hateful old
thing, and I don&rsquo;t care what you think, Nan. I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
going to watch her. You had better do it too, if
you&rsquo;re going to live to go to Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, Grace giggled. &ldquo;Nan could live through
almost anything, I believe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mama says
she never knew a girl who at Nan&rsquo;s age had had
so many adventures and had come up so smiling
from all of them. Dad agrees. He thinks Nan has
a charmed life, that she has at least nine lives&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a cat?&rdquo; Nan interrupted, for she was
embarrassed at this praise of herself. Now, her
eyes twinkled as the girls all laughed. Nan was
really a charming girl. Her clear brown eyes were
frank and trusting. Her brown, bobbed hair, cut
in a wind-blown style and brushed so that it shone
and looked soft and silky, gave her an almost
boyish appearance. But her quick sympathy, her
readiness to help anyone in distress, and her fondness
for children made a real girl of her. Everyone
liked her, but Bess Harley liked her most of
all.</p>

<p>Bess was a pretty girl with curly hair. Though
indulgent parents had spoiled her so that she was
inclined to over-value the luxuries money could
buy, her constant association with Nan through
the years had somewhat remedied that. However,
this New Year&rsquo;s Eve, she did feel out of sorts.
The thought of being separated from Nan was
still new to her. Moreover, she was envious. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
had heard some place that Linda Riggs was going
to spend the summer in Europe, and she did not
want Linda to go any place that she couldn&rsquo;t go.
Now, as she sat quietly, after expressing herself
on the matter of that overly proud young person,
she was really thinking of ways and means of
persuading her parents to let her go to Europe,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Grace brought the girls back to the
subject of Linda, &ldquo;maybe Nan is right. So, I hereby
resolve,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;to be nice to
Linda Riggs for one whole month, the month of
January. During that time, I will not say one
mean thing to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Nan applauded. &ldquo;And you, Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not Linda Riggs that troubled the
pretty southern girl. She had really never had any
direct contact with her. So when Nan turned to
her, she began, &ldquo;Well, Linda doesn&rsquo;t really annoy
me. I simply overlook her. But there is something
else that does bother me. You all know that when
I first came to Lakeview Hall, it was hard for
me to fit into your way of doing things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls nodded their heads sympathetically.
Rhoda had stood apart from them for some
weeks after her arrival but they had forgiven her
for her apparent misunderstanding of them. They
had long before forgotten that she had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
&ldquo;poor sport&rdquo; at the hazing when she first entered
Lakeview. Now Rhoda herself brought it back to
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I simply couldn&rsquo;t understand your way of making
me welcome when I came north,&rdquo; she said in
her own soft southern drawl. &ldquo;I puzzled about it
for a long time, sure all the while that you were
wrong and I was right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan caught her eye and smiled. &ldquo;We were
mean, weren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, it wasn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; the loyal Bess interposed.
&ldquo;You tried to make everything easier for
Rhoda, but we simply wouldn&rsquo;t help you. Why,
I believe we were jealous,&rdquo; she ended as though
the idea was an entirely new one. &ldquo;Girls, remember
how Rhoda looked the first time we ever saw
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were lovely,&rdquo; she went on speaking directly
to Rhoda.</p>

<p>Rhoda blushed slightly at the frank praise, but
Bess paid no heed. &ldquo;You were dressed in the most
perfect brown hat and coat I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; she
continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor will I,&rdquo; Rhoda ruefully agreed. &ldquo;I have
never in my life felt so strange and so entirely
alone. You were all talking among yourselves
and having a grand time. Everyone seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
know everyone else. I was such an outsider! And
when Laura Polk addressed me as Rollicking
Rhoda from Rustlers&rsquo; Roost, the wild Western
adventuress that you had heard so much about,
I wished that the floor would open wide and
swallow me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since it didn&rsquo;t, I wanted to turn and run, run
as fast as I could back to Rose Ranch and the people
I knew. Have you ever felt like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many, many times,&rdquo; Grace agreed heartily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to run when I flunked in recitations
before the whole class. I&rsquo;ve wanted to go away
and hide just dozens of times when things went
wrong. I can hardly bear it when Mrs. Cupp tells
me before everyone that Dr. Beulah wants to
see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Especially when Linda Riggs is there and
hears it and looks as though she was the most
perfect person in the world,&rdquo; Bess chimed in.
&ldquo;Sometimes, when I see her looking that way
when you people have to go to the office, I feel
as though I&rsquo;d like to tell all I know about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a warning look from Nan, Bess subsided.
Nan patted Grace on the shoulder. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
take those things too seriously,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We all
feel that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you just can&rsquo;t help yourself,&rdquo; Rhoda continued.
&ldquo;My mother has always tried to teach me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to have poise, but generally, when I feel as I did
that night, I forget everything she has ever said,
and I act like such a fool. I feel miserable afterwards,
because I know how disappointed she
would be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I want to resolve to be a good sport, no
matter what happens. I want to remember to
stand my ground and not run just because things
seem to be unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were silent for a moment after this.
Rhoda was so utterly sincere that they realized
for the first time how unhappy she must have
been in the days after her hazing, when for so
long they ignored her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare,&rdquo; the cheery voice of Grace&rsquo;s
mother broke in on the silence. &ldquo;A good old fashioned
round table, I do believe!&rdquo; She had entered
the room quietly and now stood alone near the
doorway. &ldquo;I hate to send you all off to bed, but it
really is getting late. Tomorrow you must all be
up early, pack, and catch that early train for
Lakeview. I promised Dr. Prescott on my word
of honor that I&rsquo;d have you all back to school on
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, the girls got up, wished one another
and Mrs. Mason a Happy New Year, and then
prepared for bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a happy, happy day,&rdquo; each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
thought as she pulled the covers up over her
shoulders and fell off to sleep. It was only Nan
who lay awake. She was thinking of her trip and
wondering what lay before her. But had the others
been able to see into the future, they, too,
would have lain awake thinking, and planning,
and hoping.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>SECRETS</small></h2>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nan?&rdquo; Rhoda whispered as she
stuck her head into Bess and Nan&rsquo;s room at Lakeview
Hall.</p>

<p>Bess got up from the gayly covered studio
couch where she had been reading and opened
wide the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Come on in,&rdquo; she
invited. &ldquo;Nan&rsquo;s gone away for the afternoon,
down to old Mrs. Bagley&rsquo;s to see how she&rsquo;s getting
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you manage?&rdquo; Rhoda asked as she
pulled off her pretty brown sports coat. &ldquo;Do you
think she smells a plot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so. She&rsquo;s been intending to
go down there for some time, and today was the
first free time she has had. I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t
suspect, but we will have to be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it! Nan&rsquo;s so smart that she will catch
on in a minute if we make her suspicious at all.&rdquo;
Rhoda lowered her voice to a whisper as someone
passed by the door. &ldquo;When are the others
coming?&rdquo; she asked when the footsteps had died
away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here any time now,&rdquo; Bess answered.
&ldquo;I can hardly wait, can you? I&rsquo;m so anxious to get
things started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhoda nodded as she peered out of the double
windows near her to see if she could sight her
friends coming up the long hill from the village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone coming, Sister Anne?&rdquo; Bess laughed.</p>

<p>Rhoda grinned. &ldquo;Do you always feel like the
sister of Bluebeard&rsquo;s wife, too, when you keep
watching for someone?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always. For some reason, that gory fairy
tale and Cinderella were my favorites when I was
a kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked them, too,&rdquo; Rhoda agreed, &ldquo;but they
weren&rsquo;t my favorites, not by any means. I was
brought up on stories of buried treasure, tales
that have been handed down from generation to
generation till no one knows whether they are
true or false.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhoda&rsquo;s eyes were alight as she spoke, and
her face had a far away look on it. She was recalling
the tales an old Spanish maid had regaled her
with as a child. They were tales of bloody massacres,
of hidden treasure, of gold and silver and
rubies and sapphires locked in heavy Spanish
chests and concealed in caves, of lost mines, richer
than any man has ever remembered, of wandering
tribes who knew the answers but would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
tell lest the wrath of God descend upon them and
wipe them all away.</p>

<p>She sighed softly.</p>

<p>Bess sat quietly, waiting and hoping that Rhoda
would talk more. But the girl was silent, as she
once more looked down the hill. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re expecting
Grace Mason, Procrastination Boggs, and
Laura Polk, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve been the closest friends Nan has
had here,&rdquo; Bess returned. &ldquo;So I asked them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was right. They were Nan&rsquo;s closest
friends, as anyone who has read the complete
Nan Sherwood series knows. Of all the girls,
Bess is the only one who has been with Nan since
the beginning. She made her appearance in the
very first volume of the series, &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at
Pine Camp, or the Old Lumberman&rsquo;s Secret.&rdquo;
This volume opens with Nan living happily on
Amity Street in Tillbury with her mother and
dad.</p>

<p>She goes to Tillbury High School, enjoys
sports, makes good grades, and is popular with
her classmates. Her only real regret, which she
carefully conceals from her parents, is the knowledge
that she cannot afford to accompany Bess
Harley to Lakeview Hall where they had both
always hoped to go together. Suddenly Papa
Sherwood loses his job and Mama inherits a fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in Scotland that makes it necessary for the
two to cross the ocean, leaving Nan behind. The
plucky young girl then accompanies her uncle, a
bluff, hearty lumberman, to Northern Michigan.
There in a series of adventures that follow one on
the other in swift succession, Nan clears up the
mystery surrounding her uncle&rsquo;s title to a valuable
piece of property and wins the admiration of all
whom she meets.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Lakeview Hall or the
Mystery of the Haunted Boathouse,&rdquo; the two
girls arrive at the big boarding school on the bluff
overlooking Lake Huron and immediately find
themselves in trouble with Laura Riggs. In chapter
after chapter of fun and excitement and thrills
galore we see the two girls at school. Constantly
getting in and out of difficulties themselves, they
involve their new friends, Grace Mason, whose
acquaintance you have already made in this book,
Laura Polk, a lively red-headed girl with a vivid
imagination, and Amelia &ldquo;Procrastination&rdquo; Boggs,
a serious soul with a roomful of clocks. But perhaps
the principal character is a ghost that nearly
does away with Mrs. Cupp, the stern watchful
assistant of Dr. Beulah Prescott, the school&rsquo;s
principal. Nan meets the ghost and conquers it
with some help from Walter Mason, Grace&rsquo;s
brother, amid much mystery and much trouble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>This over, the Masons invite Nan and her
friends to spend the Christmas holidays with them
in Chicago. So, in &ldquo;Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s Winter Holidays
or Rescuing the Runaways&rdquo; we see her continuing
her adventures in the biggest city she has
ever visited. How she makes friends with a famous
movie star and solves the mystery of the disappearance
of two young farm girls who have
come to the city to make their fortunes is told in
this volume.</p>

<p>In her next big adventure, recounted in &ldquo;Nan
Sherwood at Rose Ranch or The Old Mexican&rsquo;s
Treasure&rdquo;, our heroine and her friends meet
Rhoda Hammond a pretty, young westerner at
school and accompany her to her home, a big
ranch, for their vacation. What a vacation that is!
A raid! An antelope hunt! A stampede! Lost
treasure! And a pretty Mexican girl, Juanita!
This is a volume brimming over with new
experiences.</p>

<p>From Rose Ranch, Nan and her chums return
once more to Lakeview to work and study. They
do well, so when Mrs. Mason invites them all to
accompany Grace and Walter to Florida, they
have no trouble getting permission from home. In
&ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Palm Beach or Strange Adventures
among the Orange Groves&rdquo; they all have
a part in solving poor old Mrs. Bagley&rsquo;s troubles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and Walter has cause to admire again the boundlessness
of Nan&rsquo;s pluck.</p>

<p>She is as generous as she is plucky, and so the
Saturday afternoon on which this chapter opens,
Nan is down in Freeling, the village below Lakeview
Hall, working away in Mrs. Bagley&rsquo;s cottage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, how is Mrs. Bagley?&rdquo; Rhoda
asked, in an effort to keep herself from watching
the windows so constantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s getting along all right, I think, since
she got her money. But you know how Nan is.
She&rsquo;s always afraid something might happen.
Why, I honestly believe that she still fears that
those horrid men who tried to get the deed to
Mrs. Bagley&rsquo;s property away from her might
turn up again after they get out of prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bess Harley, I don&rsquo;t believe she thinks
any such thing!&rdquo; Rhoda exclaimed. &ldquo;You are the
one. You know you have been frightened half to
death of the dark ever since Nan had those awful
scares down in Palm Beach!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess looked guilty. &ldquo;Well, maybe it is me,&rdquo; she
conceded ungrammatically. &ldquo;But I do worry, at
times about Nan. Sometime something&rsquo;s going
to happen to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to happen to whom?&rdquo; queried a new
voice and Laura Polk, red-headed and freckle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
faced and homely but withal very likable, bounded
into the room.</p>

<p>In the confusion that followed the question
went unanswered. Grace and Amelia Boggs were
right at Laura&rsquo;s heels. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me why we are
late,&rdquo; Laura grinned impishly, &ldquo;Or I might tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just what I am afraid of,&rdquo; Bess
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll tell anyway,&rdquo; Laura
continued. &ldquo;We met a tall handsome dark-haired
man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Bess interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then he was short and fat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura Polk, you know very well that you
didn&rsquo;t meet any man at all. You either lingered
too long over the chocolate soda that you have
spilled on that plaid skirt or, and this is more
likely, you relied on Amelia&rsquo;s watch which is always
slow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t old Sherlock Holmes himself! And
what a disguise! Why, Sherlock, if it weren&rsquo;t for
your super intellect and your remarkable powers
of observation, which no one could mistake, I&rsquo;d
swear on a stack of Bibles that you were Elizabeth
Harley of Lakeview Hall, otherwise known
to her intimates as Lunch-Box Lizz. Really, Sherlock,
you amaze me,&rdquo; Laura continued as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
turned Bess slowly around. &ldquo;Amazing, truly
amazing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess laughed and blushed. &ldquo;Lunch-Box Lizz&rdquo;
was an appellation that was hard to swallow, but
she knew from of old that there was absolutely
no use in trying to silence Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she retorted, as she winked at
Rhoda, &ldquo;You missed the fudge that Mrs. Cupp
sent up to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Cupp sent you up fudge, then I&rsquo;m a
monkey,&rdquo; Laura returned. Nevertheless, she proceeded
to look around for the empty plate, muttering
the while that if Bess was any kind of
friend at all she&rsquo;d have saved some of the loot.</p>

<p>Bess watched her for a few seconds. Then
feeling anxious to get on with the business of the
day, she laughed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no plate and no
crumbs and no fudge, but you&rsquo;re a monkey, anyway,
Laura Polk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura laughed, as the other girls joined in.
&ldquo;Well, you see it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been so long since I&rsquo;ve had anything besides a
chocolate soda, that I&rsquo;m just starved for something
good to eat. But, Bess, since I wouldn&rsquo;t eat
any old chocolate fudge even if you offered it to
me on a great big silver platter, will you please
break down and tell me what all the mystery is
about.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for Pete&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Amelia exploded,
&ldquo;What have you got on your mind? You and
Rhoda have been going around the last two days
looking as though you knew the answer to why
Dr. Beulah wanted to know if our parents were
at home this winter. What a question that was!
I wrote home right away to find out what was up.
What happened? Nothing. I don&rsquo;t even get an
answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Rhoda joined
in. &ldquo;Do you know I haven&rsquo;t had a letter from
my mother for two weeks now! I hope that if
Dr. Beulah has something to write home, she
is getting more response than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re all neglected,&rdquo; Laura dismissed the
question. &ldquo;What I want to know is, what have
you two companions in mystery cooked up now?
Come on, spill it,&rdquo; she looked menacingly at Bess.</p>

<p>Bess turned to Rhoda, &ldquo;You tell them,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Rhoda shook her head, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s your idea.
Come, Bess, they are dying to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess cleared her throat. &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;, and she
looked around the room at the girls sitting on the
chairs and cross-legged on the floor. It was nice
to be there holding their attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess Harley,&rdquo; Laura threatened, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
go trying to pull any of my stunts. It&rsquo;s all right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for me to go round working up suspense, but I
won&rsquo;t have you doing it. I can&rsquo;t stand it. Are you
going to tell what&rsquo;s eating you, or aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess got up, went to the door and looked up
and down the hall, &ldquo;Just want to make sure that
Linda Riggs isn&rsquo;t around,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s not here at all now and you know
it,&rdquo; Laura laughed. &ldquo;Come on, you tell us your
secret and I&rsquo;ll tell you really and truly what Grace
and Amelia and I were doing down in the village
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess looked doubtful. &ldquo;She will, honestly,&rdquo;
Grace couldn&rsquo;t contain herself any longer. &ldquo;If she
doesn&rsquo;t, I will. Now come on, Bess, don&rsquo;t be
mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo; Bess asked. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
guess, when you know as I do that Nan will be
leaving about the end of April to go away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess,&rdquo; Rhoda chimed in, &ldquo;When
you know that it&rsquo;s a secret, that it&rsquo;s about Nan,
that you are all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Invited,&rdquo; supplied Amelia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there will be food,&rdquo; Grace put in her
bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That everybody will know eventually,&rdquo; Bess
added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it&rsquo;s to be a great big surprise party on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Nan!&rdquo; they all chorused together, and then
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! Did I hear somebody at the door?&rdquo; Bess
broke in on the confusion.</p>

<p>Immediately everybody was silent. The room
was quiet as a tomb, as Bess got up and went to
the door.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>PLANS AND MORE PLANS</small></h2>


<p>She clasped the knob firmly in her hand and
opened the door suddenly. Though she saw nothing,
she felt something soft and furry brushing
against her legs. She turned white and screamed.</p>

<p>It was Laura who brought her back to her
senses. &ldquo;Oh Bess, be quiet!&rdquo; she commanded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the whole dormitory in here. You&rsquo;ll
spoil everything. You are not afraid of a cat, are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cat!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a cat. What&rsquo;s more it is as frightened as
you are!&rdquo; Laura said in great disgust. &ldquo;How did
it get into the building anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; Bess asked shortly, for she
was still frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, there, don&rsquo;t take it so hard,&rdquo; Amelia
comforted her friend, as Bess turned to view her
unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>In a far corner of the room, its back arched
high in anger was a very black, very angry looking
cat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, pussy cat?&rdquo; Rhoda coaxed.
&ldquo;Did Bess nearly scare you out of a year&rsquo;s
growth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the cat was not to be appeased. At the
sound of Rhoda&rsquo;s voice directed toward it, it
moved, slowly, around the edge of the room with
its back still arched, however, and its heavy tail
slowly curling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooh, it <em>is</em> mad!&rdquo; Grace exclaimed as she got
up from her place on the floor. &ldquo;Better get it out
of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose I&rsquo;m trying to do?&rdquo; Bess
helplessly asked.</p>

<p>Laura took command of the situation. &ldquo;Now,
don&rsquo;t move, any of you,&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a way
with cats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Amelia rejoined, as
the black ball of fury snarled at the red-headed
girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll show you, Mrs. Cat, who is boss.&rdquo;
Laura&rsquo;s temper had been aroused. She grabbed
Grace&rsquo;s green suede jacket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of here&mdash;now,&rdquo; she ordered, shaking
it before the animal.</p>

<p>The cat turned, leaped over a chair, jumped
up on a bookcase, sprang to the window-sill and
pushing out the already loose screen, it leaped
across space to a tree outside, jumped to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ground and was disappearing around a corner
just as the girls, recovering from their surprise,
got to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is that.&rdquo; Laura pretended to wash
her hands of the whole matter. &ldquo;Did I get rid of
that cat, or didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; Bess agreed emphatically, as she
slammed down the window as though to preclude
the possibility of the animal&rsquo;s doing a leap in
reverse as she had seen swimmers do in news
reels. &ldquo;But will you tell me,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what
it all means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply that someone left a door open downstairs,&rdquo;
answered the practical Amelia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the cat smelled a mouse. So she came up
here.&rdquo; Rhoda dismissed the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you two know what I mean,&rdquo; Bess exclaimed
impatiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like black cats, especially
when they walk right in on a party I&rsquo;m
planning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it casts a great big black spell over
everything?&rdquo; Laura supplied.</p>

<p>Bess shook her head. She was almost in tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Bess,&rdquo; Rhoda put her arm around
the girl&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be like that. That black
cat can&rsquo;t do you or anybody else any harm. Don&rsquo;t
be superstitious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess smiled through her tears. &ldquo;Guess I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
more upset than I thought,&rdquo; she half apologized.
&ldquo;If that door is closed,&rdquo; she nodded toward the
one the cat had entered, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go on with what
we were talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party! The girls now all sat down close
together in a circle on the floor. It was Bess who
remembered in spite of her recent scare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you two,&rdquo; she said, addressing Laura and
Amelia. &ldquo;You had a secret, too. What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the girls looked guilty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fooled me!&rdquo; Bess was indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly that, O Suspicious One,&rdquo;
Laura denied, &ldquo;But the truth is that Amelia and
I had thought of a going away party too, and we
were down in the village to find out about how
much it would cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a whole gang of people with a single
idea,&rdquo; Rhoda laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that idea is Nan!&rdquo; Bess agreed. &ldquo;Now
let&rsquo;s get busy before she comes,&rdquo; she continued
as she raised her arm to note the time. The watch
had been a Christmas present and Bess was still
self-conscious about it and very, very proud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
four-thirty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all have to get ready
for dinner shortly, and Nan will be here, if she
isn&rsquo;t coming already,&rdquo; she added as she heard
footsteps in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like Mrs. Cupp,&rdquo; Laura whispered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; Bess breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;No
one else rustles like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good reason,&rdquo; Laura couldn&rsquo;t help adding.
&ldquo;No one else has a figure like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls giggled appreciatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will we organize this?&rdquo; Bess appealed to
Rhoda for help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have committees,&rdquo; Grace answered the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take charge of food,&rdquo; Laura jumped in
with a suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I have anything to do about it,&rdquo; Amelia
contributed her bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like to know why not!&rdquo; Laura retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply because I was just down in the village
with you and I know what kind of food we would
get, if you did the buying, just one course after
another of chocolate sodas with chocolate cream,
and then you would top it all off with devil&rsquo;s food
cake a la mode.&rdquo; With this, Amelia looked significantly
at the spot on the front of Laura&rsquo;s skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, darling, let&rsquo;s make peace,&rdquo; Laura capitulated,
&ldquo;or we will never accomplish anything at all
this afternoon. I nominate Rhoda to have charge
of the food. Do I hear a second?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I second the motion,&rdquo; Bess replied. &ldquo;All in
favor say &lsquo;Aye&rsquo;.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a chorus of &ldquo;Ayes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The motion is carried,&rdquo; Bess, the self-appointed
chairman closed the question. &ldquo;Now, who
wants to take charge of the guest list?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we getting pretty high-hat with guest
lists, and all?&rdquo; Laura asked. &ldquo;Just ask the people
to come. There doesn&rsquo;t have to be any fuss about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura, it&rsquo;s about time you grew up,&rdquo; Bess
silenced her friend. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do this party
up right. It&rsquo;s not going to be a secret midnight
spread, though they are fun,&rdquo; and her eyes twinkled
as she remembered the one down in the boathouse
at which they had entertained Mrs. Cupp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make this different than anything we have
ever had before. Let&rsquo;s make it dignified and have
everybody wear party dresses. Let&rsquo;s invite Dr.
Beulah and Professor Krenner. Nan loves them
both. I&rsquo;m sure she would feel very proud, if they
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, you will have to hire a hall,&rdquo; Grace
rather timidly interposed. &ldquo;How can we ever entertain
all those people? They&rsquo;ll scare the life out
of me. Just imagine going up to Dr. Beulah and
saying, &lsquo;We are going to have a party, will you
come to it?&rsquo; What if she said, &lsquo;No!&rsquo; Then what
would the person who had asked her say? Why, it
gives me gooseflesh just to think about it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, little Gracie, you won&rsquo;t have
to do the asking,&rdquo; Laura reassured her, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let
either Bess or Rhoda do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; Amelia approved. &ldquo;Rhoda
already has a job. Bess, you make up a list of people
you think we ought to invite and then you invite
them. It seems to me, though, if you are going
to do it in a grand manner, you really ought to write
out the invitations, and that you will have to invite
Mrs. Cupp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Amelia stuck to her point.</p>

<p>For a second Bess looked crestfallen, almost as
though she had rather give up the party than have
grim looking Mrs. Cupp present watching over it.</p>

<p>Laura, however, cheered her up. &ldquo;Never mind,
Bess,&rdquo; she consoled, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s really not so bad, you
know, after you have thawed her out with something
warm to drink and given her something good
to eat. Really, she can be quite human when she
wants to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we don&rsquo;t have to think about Linda
Riggs this time,&rdquo; Bess said in an effort to find one
patch of brightness in the situation. &ldquo;My, doesn&rsquo;t
it seem good not to have her here this term!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better than anything that has happened to us
for a long time,&rdquo; Grace agreed. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not
crow too loud about it, you never know when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
will turn up. Then you&rsquo;ll invite Mrs. Cupp, too?&rdquo;
she asked Bess, looking as though she was very
glad she didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Bess agreed half heartedly.
&ldquo;How many will we invite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering about that, too,&rdquo; Rhoda
spoke up. &ldquo;And I can see no end to a list. Nan has
so many friends that it is positively embarrassing!
We can&rsquo;t possibly have a dinner, even if Dr. Beulah
and Mrs. Cupp would let us. There just wouldn&rsquo;t
be enough room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor enough money,&rdquo; Amelia added significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Laura stuck in her oar. &ldquo;How
are we going to get the money to pay for all of
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question fell on a quiet room. No one had
thought of paying for it!</p>

<p>Finally, Bess broke in on the silence, &ldquo;Maybe I
could get my father to send me some extra money
this month,&rdquo; she offered doubtfully. &ldquo;I could write
and ask him for two months&rsquo; allowance at once. I
think he would do it.&rdquo; Bess did have a way with her
father and mother that usually secured for her
what she wanted, for she was an only child and they
loved her dearly. For this reason, she had no conception
at all of the value of money. &ldquo;You seem to
think,&rdquo; Nan often told her, &ldquo;that it is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
you go out and pick off from bushes. Don&rsquo;t you
know that people work for money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it was Amelia who put a damper on Bess&rsquo;s
generous but thoughtless offer. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be
fair at all,&rdquo; she rejected Bess&rsquo;s proposal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; This from Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we are all giving the party, and we all
want to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thata girl, Amelia,&rdquo; Laura applauded
slangily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we,&rdquo; Rhoda began slowly as though
she hadn&rsquo;t quite worked the idea out in her own
mind yet, &ldquo;make up a list of people that we know
would like to do something for Nan&mdash;goodness
knows, there&rsquo;s enough of them&mdash;and invite them
asking each one to contribute fifty cents to help
take care of expenses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t ask Dr. Beulah to give fifty
cents!&rdquo; Grace cried out without even thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Laura agreed. &ldquo;But we could
make out a list of extra special people whom we
would invite as guests. They wouldn&rsquo;t pay anything
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo; Bess chimed in. &ldquo;That takes
care of everything. At fifty cents apiece, we will
have some money left, and we can use that to buy
Nan a going away present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Laura and Amelia and I will be the committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to buy the gift,&rdquo; Grace added. &ldquo;And let&rsquo;s
have the party on a Sunday afternoon and just
serve simple refreshments so that there will be
lots of money left over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we want to get something nice for Nan,
something that she would never buy for herself
and something that she will use all the time she is
away, so that she will think of us often,&rdquo; Bess
added rather sadly, for she wasn&rsquo;t quite reconciled
yet to Nan&rsquo;s going away without her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! I hear someone coming, and it&rsquo;s not a cat
this time,&rdquo; Laura whispered in the silence that
followed Bess&rsquo;s statement.</p>

<p>Bess jumped up. &ldquo;Everybody get busy,&rdquo; she
just had time to say, &ldquo;so that this will be the very
nicest party Lakeview Hall has ever seen,&rdquo; before
Nan burst into the room on the conspirators.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>DOUBT ON ALL SIDES</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Do you think she suspects?&rdquo; Amelia asked
Laura as the two walked down the corridor of
the dormitory after working their way out of the
confusion that followed Nan&rsquo;s breaking in on
their secret meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty smart,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
never be sure but I think that Rhoda saved the
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poise that girl has!&rdquo; Amelia admired.
&ldquo;Every once in a while she does something with
such grace and tact that you can just feel the generations
of good breeding that are in back of her.
She always knows what to say and when to say it.
She&rsquo;s a girl in a million and so utterly unaware of
it all too,&rdquo; she added half wistfully.</p>

<p>Tall, thin, angular Amelia had grown somewhat
self-conscious about herself in the days since
she first came out of Wauhegan to Lakeview
Hall. It had done her good, however. She was
developing into a less abrupt, more considerate
sort of person than she was when, as a newcomer
to Lakeview, she had taken part in the Procession
of the Sawneys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is unaware of it, fortunately,&rdquo; Laura
answered. &ldquo;She would be an awful snob, if she
wasn&rsquo;t. Now, take Nan. I don&rsquo;t think she could be
a snob no matter what happened to her. She&rsquo;s
true blue all the way through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because she has known what it is to be
poor,&rdquo; Amelia replied. &ldquo;Her family has often had
to fight to get along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even money would have made a difference,&rdquo;
Laura maintained. &ldquo;Not to our Nan. Gee,
but she&rsquo;s swell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But how &ldquo;swell&rdquo; she was, neither of the girls
could really know, even as they couldn&rsquo;t know
what a big surprise the surprise party they themselves
were planning was going to be. Even as the
arch-conspirators talked and planned the days
away, a certain lady that was head of a certain
school that you have all heard about in the Nan
Sherwood books smiled to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This school is so full of plots,&rdquo; Dr. Beulah
Prescott said to herself one night as she closed
her office before retiring, &ldquo;That I&rsquo;m afraid it is
positively demoralizing.&rdquo; But as she said it, her
grey eyes twinkled and she looked for a moment
as though she liked nothing better than plots and
plotters. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; she paused as she put
the keys into her purse, &ldquo;tomorrow I must see
Professor Krenner and get in touch with Grace&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
parents again. I don&rsquo;t see how we are going to
manage about Walter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the thought, she shook her head. Then she
smiled again to herself. &ldquo;Problems, problems,
problems all the while,&rdquo; she said as if she relished
them all.</p>

<p>Alone in her own apartments in the dormitory
that night, Dr. Beulah sat down with books and
maps and plans and worked away until the small
hours of the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there something wrong?&rdquo; Nan asked the
next day as the girls left German class. Bess
started guiltily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know exactly,&rdquo; Nan replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just a feeling I have that there is something in the
air. Say, Bess, is Dr. Beulah sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Safe again,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Why, not that I know of,&rdquo; she answered
quite truthfully. &ldquo;What makes you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was up last night, late, sorting out some
things that I don&rsquo;t want to take away with me,
because I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, I was so excited. There
was a light across the garden court in Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s
apartment. I wondered about it then, but
forgot it this morning until I noticed that Dr.
Beulah was not in Chapel. That&rsquo;s quite unusual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I noticed that, too,&rdquo; Bess puzzled, &ldquo;but then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
so many strange things have been happening lately,
that I&rsquo;ve given up trying to solve them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect me to believe that?&rdquo; Nan
teased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; Bess half retracted what she
had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as interested as I once was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why, pray tell?&rdquo; Nan was curious now.</p>

<p>Bess blushed, but the postman coming down
the hall toward the offices relieved her discomfiture
and perhaps saved the situation. It was hard
for Bess to keep a secret from Nan.</p>

<p>Now they both paused to speak to the genial
old man who brought their mail up from the
village. &ldquo;Anything for us?&rdquo; It was Nan who
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, and if it isn&rsquo;t pretty Nan Sherwood this
fine mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the old Irishman paused to look
through the mail he was carrying. &ldquo;And pray,
who&rsquo;d be after writing you in this springtime. Is
it poetry you are expecting from some good-looking
young gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess giggled and Nan blushed till even the tips
of her ears were pink.</p>

<p>Old Pat went on fingering his way through the
mail, &ldquo;Dr. Prescott, Professor Krenner, Lakeview
Hall, Dr. Prescott again. Sure and she&rsquo;s a
fine lady. And another and another for her.&rdquo; He
looked up regretfully at the girls. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for you today,&rdquo; he shook his head sadly, for Pat
did love a romance. &ldquo;Sure and you&rsquo;d better tell
him where he is headin&rsquo; in,&rdquo; he shook an admonishing
finger at Nan as he started on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Pat,&rdquo; Nan and Bess stopped him again,
&ldquo;are you sure there&rsquo;s nothing there for us from
Tillbury?&rdquo; Pat sighed and looked through again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll not give up,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Well,
let&rsquo;s see. Till&mdash;Tillbury,&rdquo; he almost spelled out as
he looked at the postmarks. Nan put out her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not for you, girlie. Not today. Nothing
for either of you,&rdquo; he added and walked on,
leaving two very crestfallen and somewhat worried
girls behind him.</p>

<p>At first neither spoke, and Bess swallowed a
hard lump in her throat. Nan put an arm around
her shoulder. &ldquo;Never mind, honey,&rdquo; she consoled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably hear tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there was something there from Tillbury,
I saw it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you probably made a mistake,&rdquo; Nan said,
though she too felt sure that she had seen a Tillbury
postmark. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not such an expert at
reading upside down. Moreover, those postmarks
weren&rsquo;t stamped very plainly, and it would be
easy to misread them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, you might be able to convince yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that everything is as it should be, but you can&rsquo;t
convince me.&rdquo; Bess stamped her foot. &ldquo;Do you
know that something has happened and are you
keeping it from me?&rdquo; she half accused Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Harley, what are you saying?&rdquo; Nan
was genuinely indignant. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ve been thinking
all week that you were keeping something
from me, you&rsquo;ve been acting so strangely, but I&rsquo;ve
said nothing about it. Now you go and jump on
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This brought Bess to her senses as nothing else
could have. She laughed and with remarkable control
for her, carried the situation off and allayed
Nan&rsquo;s suspicions. &ldquo;Oh, Nan, have you?&rdquo; she burst
out. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve been acting more strangely than usual
it&rsquo;s because I have been worried about not hearing
from mother. It&rsquo;s two weeks now, you know.&rdquo;
And she seemed so utterly sincere about it, for
she was in part, that as they pushed open the big
doors of the class building they were in and
walked across the quadrangle to the Hall, Nan
believed her entirely.</p>

<p>That night, Bess was alone for a second with
Rhoda. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she confided, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so
glad when this party is over that I&rsquo;ll be willing to
kiss Mrs. Cupp&mdash;well, almost,&rdquo; she qualified, as a
picture of that lady came to her mind.</p>

<p>Rhoda laughed. &ldquo;I want to be there when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
do it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But tell me, why are you so
anxious to have the party over and done with?
I thought you loved to plan parties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, generally, but I&rsquo;m so afraid that I&rsquo;m going
to have a fight with Nan before this one is
over that I don&rsquo;t know which way to turn. We&rsquo;ve
never had a fight as long as we have known one
another. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be just my luck to have one
over something nice I was trying to do for her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you won&rsquo;t have a fight. Nan
won&rsquo;t let that happen. Anyway, the party is tomorrow
afternoon, so there is only one more day
to wait.&rdquo; Rhoda&rsquo;s face was alight, for she, too,
found it hard to wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been able to find out,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;what it is that Laura&rsquo;s committee has
bought for a present?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; Bess answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked, but
they vow they won&rsquo;t tell unless they know what
the refreshments are going to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t tell that,&rdquo; Rhoda confirmed a
previous stand. &ldquo;Besides, I think it&rsquo;s more fun, if
the committees do keep their decisions secret. It&rsquo;s
like Christmas when every cupboard and closet
in the house is brimming over with surprises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it. Do you know, I&rsquo;ll bet I won&rsquo;t
sleep a wink tonight,&rdquo; Bess admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
excited about the whole thing.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep tonight!&rdquo; Rhoda exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, I
haven&rsquo;t slept for a week!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have either, if I had had your
job,&rdquo; Bess admitted. &ldquo;I think it is the hardest
one of them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked it,&rdquo; Rhoda smiled. &ldquo;How did your
end of it work out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself, tomorrow,&rdquo; Bess
looked mysterious, too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just say this, Dr.
Beulah is the most charming person I&rsquo;ve ever
come across. She wrote the sweetest note thanking
us for the invitation! And she offered to help
us in any way she could. In fact, do you know
what she&rsquo;s done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhoda shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s solved the problem of what to do with
Nan until everything is ready. She asked her if
she would mind going down to the village tomorrow
morning on an errand that will take her all
day. Then she asked her to call Mrs. Bagley and
bring her up here for Sunday afternoon tea. And
did Nan ever fall for it? It did my heart good.
She&rsquo;s going to be the most surprised person in this
county tomorrow!&rdquo; Bess rubbed her hands gleefully.
It was fun putting something over on Nan!</p>

<p>Sunday was a grand day, bright and clear and
fresh as only an early spring day can be. The
crisp ruffles of the curtains in Nan and Bess&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
room waved slightly in the breeze. Nan dressed
herself in a fresh looking dark silk print as she
breathed deeply of the soft, warm air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s good to be alive!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;and this is one of those days when you feel sure
there is nothing but good in store for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Bess responded as unenthusiastically
as she could, for she was afraid to let Nan
even guess at her own excitement. &ldquo;My only hope
is that there is a good breakfast waiting downstairs
in the dining hall. This being Sunday, I
would like orange juice and pancakes and sausage
and some good hot cocoa with whipped cream
swimming around on top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Nan made a wry face. &ldquo;You and
Laura Polk and your whipped cream. I don&rsquo;t see
how you can bear to have it for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it trouble you, darling,&rdquo; Bess was
in an extraordinarily pleasant mood, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t
get it. You&rsquo;ll never catch Mrs. Cupp feeding us
whipped cream at any time. Says it&rsquo;s not good
for our school-girl complexions.&rdquo; With this, she
went off to bathe and dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Nan called after her, &ldquo;do
you, if I don&rsquo;t wait for you this morning. I want
to go to early chapel so that I can go down to
the village on the bus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run along, and forget me,&rdquo; Bess urged her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take my own lazy time about dressing
this morning. I&rsquo;m going to late breakfast and
late chapel and late everything. I&rsquo;ve got spring
fever with a bang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Nan went off and left a houseful of schemers
behind her.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>SURPRISE FOR EVERYONE!</small></h2>


<p>At long last came four o&rsquo;clock. Dr. Prescott
walked down the big, winding stairway of the
castle-like structure that she had transformed
from a run-down neglected dwelling into a boarding
school for girls. She was proud of the school,
proud of the work she had done there. She looked
up. Why, she was proud of every big beam that
supported the high ceilings!</p>

<p>As she entered the long reception room with
its lovely bouquets of fresh spring flowers and
was greeted by Rhoda Hammond, she had a momentary
twinge of regret. &ldquo;The girls were getting
so much older! Today,&rdquo; and she smiled a little to
herself as the thought crossed her mind, &ldquo;they
were acting especially grown-up.&rdquo; She looked
down at the lovely corsage of sweet-smelling
violets on her gray dress and touched them tenderly.
They were a gift, a thoughtful one, from
the girls who had planned the party. Now, as she
circulated among them all and felt the excitement
that there was in the room, she was glad that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had a secret too. She looked across the room and
caught Professor Krenner&rsquo;s eye. He smiled and
nodded. How nice everything seemed!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bess and Rhoda and Laura were
conferring near a big silver tea tray. There were
piles of dainty sandwiches on it, olives and pickles
and salted nuts, a plate of lemon slices with whole
cloves in the center of each, a bowl of sugar
cubes with lovely silver tongs projecting from it,
a graceful silver pitcher filled with cream, and,
off to one side, pretty cups and saucers were
stacked, waiting to be used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish Nan would come,&rdquo; Bess exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here any minute now,&rdquo; Rhoda answered,
&ldquo;and when she comes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the sentence was never finished, for just at
that moment Nan, accompanied by Mrs. Bagley,
appeared in the doorway, and with one accord
everyone called, &ldquo;Surprise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a moment such as Nan had never experienced
before. She seemed stunned, unable entirely
to comprehend what was happening. Then,
as all her friends came forward, smiled and shook
her hand and Dr. Beulah leaned over and kissed
her, she seemed to regain her composure. But she
admitted later in private to Bess that she hardly
knew all afternoon what she said or what had
been said to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>There were one or two things, however, that
did stand out clearly in her mind.</p>

<p>Before the tea was poured, Laura, as chairman
of the gift committee, called her to her side, and,
in the name of all those present, put three boxes in
her hands and told her to open them. From the
first, Nan pulled forth a gay corsage of daffodils
which Bess promptly pinned to her shoulder. How
pretty they looked there! So yellow and bright!
Nan looked down at them, seeming for a moment
to forget her other gifts.</p>

<p>Bess prodded her. So did Laura. Nan murmured
a pardon and picked up another box. It
was the largest of the three, much longer and
wider than the first and was tied with a big perky
bow which Nan proceeded to untie, oh, so slowly,
it seemed to her friends, for in her confusion her
fingers fumbled over the knot. Finally, however,
the ribbon was off, the cover removed, the tissue
paper pulled aside, and Nan drew forth a lovely
long satin negligee, more beautiful than any she
had ever seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; she exclaimed and buried her
face for a second in its softness, for she was so
happy that she was almost crying. Then she
looked out at all the faces watching her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thank you, many times I thank you,&rdquo;
she said, before she looked down at the robe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
again. It was hard to tear her eyes away from it.
But at another prod from Bess, she looked down
at the third package on the table near her. &ldquo;Could
it be&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; She opened it and pulled forth the cleverest
pair of little bedroom slippers! Everything
was just perfect!</p>

<p>Nan smiled shyly at her friends. &ldquo;What could
she say?&rdquo; In the pause that followed, Dr. Prescott
came to her rescue, moved over closer to her,
and, standing between her and Bess, she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I have the attention of all of you, for a
moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately, everyone was quiet, expectantly
waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was coming?&rdquo; The question was in
everyone&rsquo;s mind. The girls looked at Dr. Beulah
and then at one another, as a million answers
rushed through their heads.</p>

<p>She smiled reassuringly into their puzzled
faces, seemed about to speak, but then paused as
though to choose her words carefully. Finally, she
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I have ever,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;been
prouder of Lakeview Hall and all it stands for
than I have today, and today somehow marks a
turning point in its history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all know that my life has been bound
up in the fortunes of this place for some years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
now. When I first came here, there were about
twenty-five girls registered. We taught a little
French, some music, fine needlework, literature,
and something of the social graces. Walking was
about the most strenuous of the sports for girls
in those days. Hiking was unheard of, for young
ladies, I mean. It was considered quite the thing
to grow pale and to faint on the slightest provocation,
that is, if the young lady did it gracefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan here would have been quite out of place
in that old school with her bobbed hair, her keen
enjoyment of all the sports, and her interest in
Professor Krenner&rsquo;s class in architectural
drawing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls laughed. Although the course had
been listed in Lakeview Hall&rsquo;s catalogue ever
since Professor Krenner joined the faculty, Nan
had been the first to actually elect the subject.
The story of how and why she did had long ago
become a campus joke as those who have read
"Nan Sherwood at Lakeview Hall" are well aware.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time Nan herself began to
see how really queer that listing &ldquo;Architectural
Drawing&rdquo; must have looked when it first appeared
on the catalogue. She giggled, as she thought of
young women with long dresses that trailed along
the gravel paths of the campus taking such a serious
course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Sharing the joke with Dr. Beulah, she smiled
up at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Nan would have been quite out of place
there,&rdquo; Dr. Beulah repeated. &ldquo;Not one among
those twenty-five girls was trained to take care of
herself. Here, today in the very hall where they
sometimes gathered for their lessons in &ldquo;The Social
Graces&rdquo; and practiced entering and leaving the
room, using that door over there,&rdquo; she said, nodding
toward the doorway from which Nan had
first viewed the surprise party, &ldquo;you girls of the
modern day have planned a party for one of your
number who has had more adventures than those
girls had ever dreamed or read about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas they walked, danced some, and
fainted most expertly, you go boating, hiking,
horseback riding, and, in the winter, sleighing.
You play basketball and volleyball and golf. How
they would envy you! Now, your party is for one
among you who is going to Europe. There, all
sorts of adventures await her. Just as Nan cannot
imagine what these will be, just as I could not
have twenty years ago imagined this big school
with its two hundred self-reliant girls, you young
ladies in planning this party had no conception of
what a big thing was going to happen to you
shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While you have been whispering and plotting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
among yourselves looking forward to this day
which is being so successful, I, too, have been fostering
a few secrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Bess looked over at Nan. There was an
I-told-you-so gleam in her eye. Nan nodded
quickly. They were both thinking of their conversation
of a few days ago in the corridor, both
remembering their disappointing encounter with
the old mailman. They turned their eyes back toward
Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s face. How sweet she looked!
Nan sighed. If she would only hurry and get to
the point of her talk! Nan felt that she simply
could not wait any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan&rsquo;s parents,&rdquo; Dr. Beulah continued, &ldquo;felt
that they wanted her to go to Europe under the
chaperonage of some responsible person, and so,
several months ago they wrote to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was news to Nan, and she was all attention
as Dr. Beulah went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made inquiries of the schools and colleges
which offer conducted tours and was about to recommend
that Nan join a party from a girls&rsquo; school
on the Hudson that was going to England. However,
before the letter was written to Mr. and
Mrs. Sherwood, Grace Mason&rsquo;s mother asked me
a question that has changed everyone&rsquo;s plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhoda Hammond put a reassuring arm around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Grace, who blushed slightly as all eyes were
turned on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She and Mr. Mason,&rdquo; the head of the school
explained, &ldquo;wondered whether it would be possible
for me to recommend a girls&rsquo; camp for
Grace to stay in for the summer. Well, one thing
led to another, and before the week was out Professor
Krenner and I were in conference behind
closed doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a result, plans have been definitely made,&rdquo;
her voice was clear and firm in spite of the excitement
in it, &ldquo;for a whole party of you to go to
England this spring to see the king and queen
crowned in London!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>ADVENTURES AHEAD!</small></h2>


<p>There was a murmur of surprise in the room
as Dr. Prescott made her announcement. She
raised her hand to quiet it and waited a moment
before she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much as I would have liked to have all of
you go,&rdquo; she continued finally to the expectant
girls before her, &ldquo;that was impossible. So, it was
necessary to choose those girls who have been
outstanding in one way or another since they have
been here at school. Another year, there will be
more of you able to go, for I hope on this trip
to be able to establish contacts that will make exchange
scholarships between Lakeview Hall and
similar schools abroad, possible. Therefore, to
those who have that keen desire to make the trip,
to be explorers too, and do not find their names
on the list which I shall read presently, I want
to say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be too disappointed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of you are younger than the girls who
have been chosen, and your opportunity will come
when you are a little older. Then you may profit
by the experiences that we shall have on this first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
trip, yes, and by our mistakes too, for, in a sense,
we shall be explorers setting out for strange countries.
We are going to find out for sure whether
the things we have been reading and hearing
about for these many years are true. We are
going to see whether, if we board a boat in New
York and sail east, we really come to a continent
called Europe on our maps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those of you who follow after, will but verify
our findings and will have as strange and wonderful
experiences then, as we shall have now. So,
again I say, you will not be the girls I think you
are, if you do not, after the list is read, rally
round those girls who are going. Help them all
you can. There is much to do between now and
the time they sail, and they and the school will
need your help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now after conferences with your parents and
teachers, I have chosen and secured permission
for the following six girls to go: Nan Sherwood,
Amelia Boggs, Grace Mason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was tense with suspense as she
paused to clear her throat, for she was excited
too, almost as excited as the girls themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhoda Hammond&mdash;&rdquo; She smiled over at the
girl, for she was fond of this proud southern girl,
so different, she thought, than the rest of her
brood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura Polk and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan put her arm around Bess&rsquo; shoulder. The
same question was in both their minds. Could it
be possible that Bess&rsquo; name was not on the list?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth&mdash;Harley!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was in a hubbub. Nan was kissing
Bess and Bess kissing Nan; Rhoda, shaking hands
with Laura; Laura, telling Grace not to cry; Dr.
Beulah Prescott, looking as though her customary
serenity was most difficult to maintain; and Professor
Krenner was smiling his kindly smile on
all of them.</p>

<p>Everyone shook hands with everyone else and
the girls that weren&rsquo;t going were so lifted up by
the excitement that they hardly knew who was
going and who was not. In the commotion, Rhoda
somehow or other managed to pour the tea, and
Amelia, Bess, Nan, Laura, and Grace to pass the
sandwiches and olives and pickles and cakes and
nuts and candies, but no one, as Rhoda dolefully
remarked afterwards, knew what they were
eating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The refreshment committee could have served
mounds of spinach,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;instead of molded
boats of ice-cream, and no one would have been
the wiser.&rdquo; Maybe so. At any rate, the little
round sandwiches, the long narrow sandwiches,
and the sandwiches shaped like balls and covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with cheese, were all eaten to the last crumb. The
olives, pickles, and nuts disappeared. Finally, the
ice cream and fancy cakes were all gobbled up,
too, so that when the matron of the Hall had the
maid wheel out the tea-wagon, none of Rhoda&rsquo;s
refreshments were left.</p>

<p>It was quite the nicest party Lakeview Hall had
ever had. That night no one slept very soundly,
least of all the six girls on Corridor Four who
were going to England for the Coronation of the
King and Queen.</p>

<p>All rules, Dr. Prescott, had wisely said, would
be suspended for the one night. Though Mrs.
Cupp shook her head lugubriously over the &ldquo;goings
on&rdquo;, at ten o&rsquo;clock that night Laura, Grace,
Amelia and Rhoda found themselves by one accord
collected in Bess and Nan&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s all a dream?&rdquo; Rhoda asked as
they lounged about on the day-bed and in the easy
chairs. &ldquo;What if we awaken tomorrow and find
that none of it&rsquo;s true, that it is as we thought
when we planned the party in the first place?
What if we find that only Nan is going after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be a dream. That would be a
nightmare,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;The thing I can&rsquo;t
understand is, how I managed to get in under the
wire. I was never more surprised in all my life
than I was when she read my name. Imagine me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the red-headed cyclone from nowhere, going to
Europe. Even my well-known imagination fails at
the prospect. I can believe some of my own stories
quicker than this one that the powers that be
have thought up. Truth is indeed stranger than
fiction. I never thought that I would live,&rdquo; she
said as though she was at least a hundred, &ldquo;to see
the day when I would admit that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor did I either,&rdquo; Nan said contentedly. How
pleased she was that all her friends were going!
&ldquo;Remember the night we sat up like this in this
very room and talked of going to Florida. We
thought nothing could be so grand as that! Now
the whole lot and caboodle of us,&rdquo; she went on
inelegantly, &ldquo;are going on a little jaunt over to
Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Laura laughed and tried to yawn, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
all in a day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing that tickles me,&rdquo; Bess spoke up at
last, she had been quite silent since the party,
unable yet to accept the fact that she was, after
all, going to Europe with her chum, &ldquo;is the way
Dr. Beulah kept my name until last. Did you see
the twinkle in her eye when she finally read it off?
I almost died of suspense when she said &lsquo;Elizabeth&rsquo;
and then hesitated for so long before she
said &lsquo;Harley&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, too,&rdquo; Nan said. &ldquo;Really, Bess, if your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
name hadn&rsquo;t been on that list with all the others
I would have wept bitter tears with you. I don&rsquo;t
believe I could have gone without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, do you mean that, honestly?&rdquo; Bess
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honest and truly,&rdquo; Nan reiterated. &ldquo;But,
girls,&rdquo; she cried suddenly to them all, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
something I know that none of you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; they all chorused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to tell or
not,&rdquo; Nan teased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan Sherwood,&rdquo; Bess threatened, &ldquo;if you
don&rsquo;t break right down and tell us at once I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
throw this pillow at you.&rdquo; With this,
she picked up one big soft pillow and raised her
arm as though to pitch it right at Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give up,&rdquo; Nan capitulated amid much
laughter. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said slowly and
solemnly as though to give her words greater
weight, &ldquo;That Professor Krenner is going to
Europe, too, this summer, that he will be in London
when we are, and that he will take us on
some of the sight-seeing tours that we are to
take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Grace Mason depreciated.
&ldquo;I know something better, that none of
you know. My mother and father are going to
London and they are going to meet us there before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
we leave! What&rsquo;s more, they are going to
take Walter with them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan blushed. She had been secretly wondering
whether or not Walter was going to get a chance
to go to Europe this summer. She had been reluctant
to ask Grace, because she hated so to be
teased. Now she tried to be nonchalant about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; she said, trying to act very
much disinterested. The girls exchanged significant
glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> it,&rdquo; they emphasized.</p>

<p>Nan was dying to ask how it happened that
Walter was going and who it was that had told
Grace, but she didn&rsquo;t dare to ask any questions.
She held her peace and hoped that someone else
would solve the riddle.</p>

<p>For a few moments, no one said anything. It
was like a mutual conspiracy to tantalize Nan,
but after a while, Bess&rsquo; own curiosity got the
better of her. &ldquo;How do you know, Grace,&rdquo; she
asked, &ldquo;surely no mail has come through to you
lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a particle!&rdquo; Grace exploded. &ldquo;But Dr.
Beulah says that everyone has been so busy with
these plans, writing back and forth, checking and
rechecking on details, that there was no time to
write just ordinary letters. It was she who told
me that dad is going over on business and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Walter and mother are going along with him.
Why, I&rsquo;m almost as pleased as Nan,&rdquo; she tormented
her friend further, though she was secretly
pleased that Nan liked her brother so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me, Nan,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;What were
you and Dr. Beulah talking about so earnestly in
the corner over your tea. I wanted like everything
to interrupt, but even though everything
was so informal that no less a person than Mrs.
Cupp condescended to congratulate us, I hesitated
to break in on one of Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s tete--tetes.
I hope she doesn&rsquo;t scare the life out of me, while
we are away. Imagine, being with her every day,
eating&mdash;you do eat on a boat, don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;at her
table, walking the deck with her, and perhaps
even sharing your cabin with her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan laughed heartily at Grace&rsquo;s last exclamation.
&ldquo;Why, Grace Mason,&rdquo; she burst forth, after
she had wiped her eyes with her handkerchief,
&ldquo;If you were dressed in clothes instead of those
pajamas, I&rsquo;d take you by the ear right now and
march you straight over to Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s apartment
and introduce her to you. She doesn&rsquo;t bite.
She&rsquo;s one of the nicest, if not the very nicest,
person I have ever known. I can&rsquo;t imagine a pleasanter
person in all this wide world to take us on
this trip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was telling me,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and in answer to Grace&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;that
we are to go over on a steamship line that will
land us in Glasgow, for we are to stop first at
Emberon. It seems some distant relatives of mine
want to be the first to welcome us when we land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed. &ldquo;All the words
about going sound like magic, don&rsquo;t they? Sailing,
walking on deck, landing, and passports and visas
and going through customs. Do you know,&rdquo; she
admitted, &ldquo;it almost scares me, when I think of
all the strange new things that are going to happen.
Why, we will be foreigners in a strange
country!&rdquo; she ended in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I hope they don&rsquo;t treat us as we treat
them sometimes,&rdquo; Nan added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they hadn&rsquo;t better,&rdquo; Bess retorted indignantly,
as all the girls joined heartily in laughing
at her. Bess laughed too, when she realized
what she had said, &ldquo;What I mean is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Bessie,&rdquo; Nan comforted. &ldquo;We
know you are not as rude as you sound, and that
you don&rsquo;t mean half of what you say,&rdquo; she ended
teasingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care what you say,&rdquo; Bess returned
nobly, &ldquo;I feel so happy that I am going to be on
that boat with all of you that there is nothing
that you could say that would bother me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even,&rdquo; Laura goaded her, &ldquo;the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that we are going over cabin class while Linda
Riggs is going first class on the same boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Bess denied without thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t, Bess,&rdquo; Rhoda looked reprovingly
across at Laura. &ldquo;No one has heard a
thing about Linda for months now. She might just
as well be living in another world so far as we
are concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish she was.&rdquo; Bess pouted somewhat as
she made the statement. The truth was that she
was secretly triumphant at the thought that if
Linda was going to Europe, she was too. She
half hoped that somewhere they would meet, that
sometime she would be able to embarrass Linda
as Linda had frequently, in the past embarrassed
her. But even as the thought crossed her mind,
Nan whisked it away by saying, &ldquo;I wonder what
it will all be like!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>A MYSTERIOUS LETTER</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, there&rsquo;s so much to do before we
go that I sometimes think we never will get
started!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed to her roommate one
morning several weeks later.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the floor sorting a boxful
of things she had been saving for her memory
book and was holding the dance program of the
Grand Guard Ball they had attended during their
first year at Lakeview, when she spoke.</p>

<p>Nan did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, aren&rsquo;t you listening to what I say?&rdquo; she
asked without looking up. She flourished the
dance program in the air. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this bring up
memories though,&rdquo; she said half wistfully. &ldquo;When
I remember what a jewel Walter was that night,
I&rsquo;m almost jealous,&rdquo; she went on.</p>

<p>Again there was no answer. Bess looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nan Sherwood, whatever is the matter?&rdquo;
she cried when she saw the expression on
Nan&rsquo;s face. Dropping the things in her lap on the
floor, she got up and went over to the day-bed
where Nan was reading a letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, tell me,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
looking as though the bottom had dropped out of
everything. What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; Nan forced a smile, &ldquo;I
just received a letter from home and it made me
homesick. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You homesick!&rdquo; Bess didn&rsquo;t believe a word
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nan reiterated rather crossly, &ldquo;I began
to think how far away we are going and how
seldom it is we see our parents these days. It made
me sad for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess accepted the explanation without further
comment. She knew that it wasn&rsquo;t altogether true,
just as she knew that it would be utterly impossible
to drag the real facts from Nan at the
moment. However, she determined not to forget
the incident. But despite her resolve, it was not
until several weeks later when they were on the
other side of the Atlantic Ocean that the subject
was reopened. Then it was not Bess who reopened
it, but a set of very peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>Now, to further divert Bess&rsquo; attention, Nan put
her letter away, most carefully, and began to
busy herself about the room. So, they were both
sorting out their belongings when Grace broke in
on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; She was breathless with
excitement for she had run all the way from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
mail boxes where she had read the letter she was
now waving in her hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just had a letter
from home and mother and dad say that you
should all come to Chicago with me for a few
days during the holidays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say that it is almost necessary,&rdquo; she continued
as she noted the doubtful look on Nan&rsquo;s
face and Bess&rsquo; too. &ldquo;Because you can take care
of your passports and visas much easier there than
from Freeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother says further,&rdquo; and Grace turned to
her letter to read directly from that,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dad and I have at last given Walter our
consent to take his car along with him. He wants
to so much! We feel that since it might be the
only time he ever makes the trip that we will let
him do as he wishes in so far as possible. So you
and the girls may plan on taking a few side trips
to Stratford-on-Avon, Canterbury, Eton, Windsor,
and wherever else you have a mind to go by
auto&mdash;that is, and this always holds true, if Dr.
Prescott is willing. You are to be in her hands
entirely, you know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t fail to keep in touch with me,
Grace. I want to know at every step how your
plans are progressing.<br />

<span  class="rght2">&ldquo;&lsquo;My love,</span><br />
<span  class="rght">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;just&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;grand!&rdquo; Bess was
the first to speak after the letter was finished.
&ldquo;Oh, Grace, your mother and dad are so good to
us. Think of it, Nan, we will be able to take
some drives over the lovely English countryside in
the spring of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Nan answered quietly, though inside
she was really more excited than Bess. She liked
Walter&rsquo;s car and had already had some pleasant
drives in it. Now, she could see herself in imagination
skimming over the English roads. &ldquo;By the
way,&rdquo; she turned to Grace, &ldquo;when is it Walter
will be crossing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not until several weeks after we do,&rdquo;
Grace answered. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s going to be busy until
well into April. But we&rsquo;ll all be together for the
coronation, I am sure. Did I tell you this? Mother
says someplace at the beginning of her letter that
a business acquaintance of Dad&rsquo;s has written that
we may watch the procession go by from his
offices. It seems he is right down in Piccadilly and
has an ideal location. The King and Queen and
all of them will pass right by there on their way
to Westminster from Buckingham Palace to be
crowned. Then, they will pass by, too, on their
way back. Why, dad says that if we bought such
seats, we would have to pay at least a hundred
dollars apiece!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grace, what would we do without you!&rdquo;
Nan exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the biggest piece of news
yet! Dr. Prescott has been having trouble getting
good seats for us, I know, for we put in our bid
so late. I wrote to the solicitors in Edinburgh
who handled mother&rsquo;s inheritance just the other
day to find out whether anything could be done.
It will be almost a month before I can possibly
hear, and I was so afraid that it would be too
late! Now, you have settled the problem entirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace blushed. She adored Nan. Praise from
her sent her spirits skyward. Now she returned
to her original question. &ldquo;Will you stop in Chicago
at the beginning or the end of the vacation,&rdquo;
she persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, at the end,&rdquo; Nan capitulated. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
possibly stop at the beginning, I am that anxious
to get home and see Momsey! There are at least
a million questions I want to ask her about all of
this. I wish the Easter vacation was twice as long
as it is and that it was going to begin tomorrow.
Then I wish that we were leaving the day after
vacation ends. Oh, girls, I sometimes feel I&rsquo;m
going to burst!</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only knew how much I&rsquo;ve wanted to
see all those places Momsey and Papa wrote
about when they were over in Scotland a year or
so ago! They tell me that the old castle that belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to the ancient Lairds of Emberon is a
queer spooky old place. Most of it is not in use
anymore, but there are a few rooms that have
never been closed. These are the ones that are to
be ours for the time we stay there. Sounds thrilling,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thrilling!&rdquo; Bess took up the word. &ldquo;Why,
there&rsquo;s nothing like this trip ever happened to us
before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you people cooking up now?&rdquo; It
was Laura&rsquo;s voice that broke in on them. &ldquo;I declare,
sometimes I think I&rsquo;d better move my trunk
and belongings right into this room. Then I&rsquo;d be
on the spot when things happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sentiments exactly,&rdquo; Rhoda chimed in as
she entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Late as usual,&rdquo; Laura observed as Amelia
also came in. &ldquo;Now tell us what we&rsquo;ve been
missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re all to stop at Grace&rsquo;s in Chicago
before we come back to school. Her mother has a
whole list of things that can best be done from
there.&rdquo; Bess couldn&rsquo;t wait for Grace to extend the
invitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; Nan verified Bess&rsquo;
statement. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;d all better clear out of
here,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I love every hair of your
funny heads, but I can&rsquo;t accomplish a thing when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
you&rsquo;re around. Do you realize that after all, we&rsquo;re
at school, and that trip or no trip, we&rsquo;ve got to
get through with exams before we leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls sobered up at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooh Nan, don&rsquo;t bring them up,&rdquo; Laura
begged. &ldquo;I just remembered that I faithfully
promised the French Prof that I&rsquo;d prepare my
lesson for tomorrow. She declared today that she
was utterly disgusted with the assignments I had
been handing in. Poor thing! I have been trying
her patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I and I and I,&rdquo; they all chorused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, get out!&rdquo; Nan laughed, but never-the-less
achieved firmness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, guess we&rsquo;d better take the hint.&rdquo; Laura
started for the door and the others followed.
&ldquo;Bet I get a better French grade than any of
you, tomorrow,&rdquo; she challenged, just before the
door was closed behind them with an air of
finality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such people!&rdquo; Nan laughed to Bess when
they were once more alone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing
I&rsquo;m sure of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo; Bess looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cupp is going to be so happy when the
bus drives away from the entrance of this school
carrying all of us and our baggage, that, if she
were human at all, she&rsquo;d dance a little jig of joy.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Bess giggled. &ldquo;If I thought she&rsquo;d do that I&rsquo;d
almost be willing to stay, for that would be something
worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, there are so many things worth seeing,&rdquo;
Nan took up the end of the sentence seriously,
&ldquo;that I wish I were quintuplets so that I could be
in at least five places at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and me, too,&rdquo; Bess agreed, &ldquo;but just now
the one me that is here is going to buckle down
to work. Those exams are no joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the two girls took out their books, and before
long there was no sound to be heard in the
room but the ticking of the clock and the occasional
turning of a page. They studied until the
signal came, &ldquo;Lights out!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>OLD FRIENDS AND AN ENEMY</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Welcome to our city!&rdquo; It was Walter&rsquo;s hearty
voice greeting Nan and Bess as their train pulled
into the busy Chicago station.</p>

<p>Nan caught her breath. How nice he looked!
How much older he seemed. She smiled up at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to have a habit of meeting us at
stations,&rdquo; she remarked. They all laughed, remembering
Nan and Bess&rsquo; first entrance into
Freeling, their first ride with Walter and Linda
Riggs&rsquo; consequent anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you seem to have a habit of going
places,&rdquo; Walter returned as he smiled back at
them. How pretty they looked! How much older
they seemed! How pink Nan&rsquo;s cheeks were! Could
it be that she was embarrassed? The very same
thoughts that were running through Nan&rsquo;s mind
were running through his. They both felt easier
when Grace, Amelia, Laura, and Rhoda descended
on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, you old pokes,&rdquo; Grace said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got things to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Amelia contributed her bit, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
late already.&rdquo; With this she looked meaningly at
her latest acquisition&mdash;a new wristwatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, another?&rdquo; Laura appeared to be
stunned at the information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, funny,&rdquo; Amelia wrinkled up her nose at
her friend. &ldquo;It was a going away present from
my dad. Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls all crowded round to see. It was a
pretty little thing, small and oblong and tailored
looking and it went quite perfectly with the pretty
tailored suit that Amelia was wearing. She turned
it so they could see her initials on the back and
the date, all engraved in Old English style.</p>

<p>Now as they crowded into the Mason town car
and were whisked away to the big Mason home,
they compared notes on their visits. Nan and Bess
had been to four&mdash;no less than four&mdash;bon voyage
parties, and they were laden with all sorts of gifts
from their friends and former class-mates at Tillbury
High School. Rhoda was the proud possessor
of new luggage, the gift of cowboys on her
Dad&rsquo;s ranch. Amelia had her watch, Grace a sizable
check to do with as she pleased on her trip.
And Laura had the greatest surprise of all.</p>

<p>She had had her bright red hair curled so that
it was like a soft halo all around her pert little
face! &ldquo;Turn around,&rdquo; the girls commanded when
she took her hat off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks just darling, Laura,&rdquo; Bess said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly lovely,&rdquo; Nan agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the
belle of the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really like it?&rdquo; Laura sounded just a
little worried as she looked at them. &ldquo;Do you
think that Dr. Prescott will approve?&rdquo; she asked
Nan anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she will,&rdquo; Nan answered confidently.
&ldquo;Why Laura,&rdquo; she said, turning her
friend&rsquo;s head around so that she could get a side
view again, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve changed from an ugly duckling
to a pretty young lady. I don&rsquo;t see how Dr.
Prescott could possibly object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura grinned roguishly. &ldquo;Do you know, when
I look into the mirror, I hardly recognize myself,
but then when I open my mouth and hear what
comes out, I&rsquo;m perfectly sure that I haven&rsquo;t
changed a bit. Then I feel utterly discouraged.&rdquo;
She looked as woeful as possible, when she finished
the sentence, but nothing could disguise the
fact that Laura and the whole crowd of Lakeview
Hall students were on top of the world. It was a
merry bunch that tumbled out of the car and into
the Mason home.</p>

<p>In no time at all, they had unpacked, washed,
changed their clothes and were coming down the
broad stairway together for lunch. They stopped
midway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose voice is that?&rdquo; Bess whispered the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be&mdash;&rdquo; Nan paused to listen again,&mdash;&ldquo;Dr.
Beulah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; Grace laughed. &ldquo;In the excitement,
I forgot entirely to tell you. Mother
asked her to stop on her way back to school, too,
and we are all to go together this afternoon for
our passports.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, come here!&rdquo; It was Nan&rsquo;s whisper
again, arresting Laura who had tried to retreat
up the stairway as soon as she heard Dr. Beulah.
Nan caught her by the arm. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to face the music sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just give me a little time,&rdquo; Laura entreated.
&ldquo;This is too unexpected. Let me have time to
think up something to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you would be in trouble.&rdquo; Nan started
down the stairs. &ldquo;Come on, brace up,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>At that moment, Mrs. Mason heard them all
and came to the stairway. &ldquo;Come, girls,&rdquo; she
called. &ldquo;Lunch is ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan held fast to Laura&rsquo;s arm and advanced
into the room.</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott looked up at their entrance.
&ldquo;Why, Nan, how well you are looking.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;Laura! Why, Laura Polk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura looked sheepish and blushed, but for
once no words came forth. Dr. Prescott looked at
her thoughtfully. Finally, the verdict came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; she said slowly, but with a bright
gleam in her eye. &ldquo;I must admit that though I
have always been opposed to artificial curls, you
look very charming, Laura, and I don&rsquo;t blame you
a bit for doing it. Now, turn around so that I can
see the back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is indeed&mdash;charming, very becoming
to you,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it, girls?&rdquo;
she nodded toward the others and in the general
conversation that followed, Laura regained her
composure.</p>

<p>Lunch was followed by a conference in the Mason
library. Then they were all whisked off to the
photographers to have passport pictures taken.
Each one was taken into a small room, seated on
a chair, and told to look straight into the camera.
In a second it was all over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they look just awful!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed
when she saw hers. &ldquo;Why, they can&rsquo;t use that
thing to identify me. I won&rsquo;t even admit that I
posed for that.&rdquo; She laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But will you look at mine!&rdquo; this from Laura.
&ldquo;I look like&mdash;like&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Puck,&rdquo; Nan supplied the word which
Laura was searching for. &ldquo;Imagine the trouble
we&rsquo;ll have dragging you past immigration officials
and through customs. We&rsquo;ll have to explain to
every officer we meet, &lsquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t Puck. This is
Laura Polk.&rsquo; And they&rsquo;ll look at you and make
marks in their notebooks. Then they&rsquo;ll talk among
themselves and debate as to whether or not they
should lock you up in a dark dungeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the girl, Nan.&rdquo; Laura commended her
friend, &ldquo;And if they hear you they&rsquo;ll lock you up
with me. The United States Government will protest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Amelia cut in. &ldquo;It will send
word to keep you locked up, two such crazy loons!
Now, if we don&rsquo;t get a move on, the Passport
Agent&rsquo;s office will be closed and none of us will
ever be able to even leave the country!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about not leaving the country?&rdquo;
Dr. Prescott came into the room from an inner
office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we were just teasing Laura,&rdquo; Nan explained,
&ldquo;about her passport photo. They are all
really very poor, Dr. Prescott. Do you think that
they will be all right?&rdquo; Nan was genuinely worried.</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott smiled at her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, dear,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
she reassured her. &ldquo;Everything will be quite all
right, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed so. They went to the Passport
Agent&rsquo;s office, stopped at a bank to find out about
foreign money, to tea&mdash;&ldquo;so that we can get used
to having it in England in the middle of the afternoon,&rdquo;
Grace explained.</p>

<p>Before they parted so that each might do her
own errands, Dr. Prescott called Nan aside.
&ldquo;Will you do something for me, Nan,&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Nan was all eagerness. It was an
honor to be asked to help Dr. Prescott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you stop at the travel agent&rsquo;s on Madison
Avenue and pick up the portfolio of maps
and time-tables he is holding there for me? You
can&rsquo;t miss the place, it&rsquo;s near the Wrigley Building,
and it has a huge revolving globe of the world
in the window. It won&rsquo;t take you long, and it
might be an interesting place to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How interesting and upsetting this errand
would be&mdash;neither could know as Nan waved
good-bye to her friends and went off adventuring
by herself. Just as Dr. Prescott had said, she
couldn&rsquo;t miss the Wrigley Building, nor the window
with the revolving globe. She stood for a
second watching it, watching North and South
America, the Atlantic Ocean, Europe and Africa,
Asia and Australia, the Pacific Ocean merge, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
into the other, as the ball moved around. Then
she tore herself away, opened the door, and went
in.</p>

<p>There, standing at a long counter talking to the
agent, was Linda Riggs, proud and superior looking
as usual! Nan gasped. Linda turned, and the
two faced one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Linda!&rdquo; Nan spoke first, but Linda
looked her up and down, stared into her face
coldly and most rudely, and then, without saying
a word, turned her back.</p>

<p>Nan tried to cover up her confusion, as she
went forward to claim Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s folio. Could
she have made a mistake? She looked again. No,
no one could mistake the angle of that up-turned
chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the cabin on the upper deck,&rdquo; she
heard Linda say in her slow affected way. &ldquo;I want
the very best cabin you have,&rdquo; she said, talking
a little louder so that Nan couldn&rsquo;t help but hear.
&ldquo;I always like the best of everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was really disgusting to hear the girl talk.
Everyone in the office looked up at her. She might
have been a pretty girl, but instead she looked
over-dressed, haughty, and artificial. Two or three
in the room laughed to themselves and turned
away. They did not even like to look at her.
Others shook their heads. Nan tried not to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
any attention. She wanted to get out of the office
as soon as possible. She asked for Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s
package quietly and would have gone without even
looking at Linda again, but that girl&rsquo;s own words
stopped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she heard Linda saying
to one of the agents, &ldquo;but who is that girl that is
leaving now. It&mdash;seems that I have seen her someplace
before. Oh, yes, she is the one who was
caught shoplifting in a Chicago department
store.&rdquo; She said it loudly so that everyone could
hear.</p>

<p>Nan stopped. They couldn&rsquo;t say that about her.
It wasn&rsquo;t true! She knew it, and so did Linda.
Everyone who has read &ldquo;Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s Winter
Holidays&rdquo; knows it. But here Linda was, declaring
it was true in front of a whole crowd of
strange people!</p>

<p>Nan wanted to protest, but the agent who had
given her Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s package spoke quietly.
&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; he said, for he knew that what
Linda was telling was a lie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say nothing.
Here, let me help you.&rdquo; He took her by the arm
and escorted her to the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it bother
you,&rdquo; he said as she went out.</p>

<p>Linda turned and followed Nan with her eyes.
&ldquo;What strange people,&rdquo; she drawled, &ldquo;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
meets.&rdquo; No one paid any attention. They had
liked Nan.</p>

<p>Outside, Nan held the package close to her
side and lost herself in the crowd. It had been
hard, not answering Linda, but by keeping still,
she had won the day. Now, as she walked along
Madison Avenue thinking of what had happened,
she remembered Linda&rsquo;s first statement, &ldquo;I want
a cabin on the upper deck, the best you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she thought of it, she breathed a short
prayer. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t let Linda be on the same
boat with us,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THEY&rsquo;RE OFF</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Ticket&mdash;passport&mdash;traveller&rsquo;s checks&mdash;baggage
tags&mdash;trunk keys.&rdquo; Nan checked them
off on her list as she put them into her purse.
&ldquo;There, Bess,&rdquo; she said, turning to her friend,
&ldquo;everything is done, and I&rsquo;m all ready, absolutely
all ready to go. And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls were standing in their room in
Lakeview Hall as Nan asked the question. They
were both dressed in tweed coats and matching
felt hats. Around them stood their baggage, waiting
for the school janitor to take it down to the
school bus. It was the day of all days, the day on
which they were leaving for Europe.</p>

<p>Bess looked bewildered as Nan put the question
to her. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;guess so. I guess I&rsquo;m all
ready,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;m so
excited that I hardly know whether I&rsquo;m going or
coming. I can&rsquo;t remember what I packed and what
I didn&rsquo;t pack. I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t even
know where my baggage keys are!&rdquo; she exclaimed
as she began to look frantically around the room.
&ldquo;What will I do?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Already she was moving pillows, looking under
books, in the corners of chairs, and around the
floor. Nan joined the hunt and when Laura, a few
seconds later, stuck her head in the doorway, they
were both turning the room upside down in search
of the keys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you two,&rdquo; the red-headed girl began,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming for your trunks next. Be ready.
We&rsquo;ve just time to catch the train.&rdquo; With this
she disappeared.</p>

<p>They heard Rhoda&rsquo;s voice down the hall.
&ldquo;Everybody ready? The bus is coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They heard Amelia. &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;Dr.
Prescott says to come downstairs. It&rsquo;s time to go.&rdquo;
She sang the words out.</p>

<p>But it was not until they themselves heard the
chug-chug of the old school bus as it rolled up to
the entrance and came to a halt that Nan discovered
the keys in the most obvious place of all,
the lock of the trunk itself!</p>

<p>Now everything was all right. Bess gave one
more look at herself in the mirror. The janitor
came for the luggage. The girls took one last
lingering look at their room. Then they left.</p>

<p>The next morning they awakened in New York
City to one of the most exciting days they had ever
had. Everything around them was new, for none
of them had ever been to this largest city in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
world before. As they came out of Grand Central
Station, with porters hurrying after them with
their luggage, they were caught up in a rush of
people hurrying to work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan!&rdquo; Bess grabbed for her friend&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed. &ldquo;Did you ever see
anything like it!&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s face was shining. She
looked around for the rest of their crowd, caught
Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s eye, and smiled. It was all so new
and so much fun! Dr. Prescott smiled back. But
there was not time to say anything.</p>

<p>They piled into a big car and went threading
through the heavy morning traffic, under elevated
railway tracks, past tall white buildings, through
narrow crowded streets, around big double decker
busses, and finally rolled to a stop at the
wharves.</p>

<p>There ship after ship was lying in the docks.
There were great big ones, bigger than any hotel
they had ever seen; little fishing schooners with
loose sails flapping in the breeze; busy tugs nosing
around; and off in the distance, a gray United
States battleship was lying at anchor.</p>

<p>Everyone was hustling about. The place seemed
one mad scramble of porters, sailors, travellers,
trunks, luggage carts, and taxis depositing more
and more people all the time. It seemed as though
the whole United States was sailing off for foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ports. Unconsciously, the girls huddled together.
Dr. Prescott looked anxiously down at her brood
and realized for the first time what a task she had
undertaken. Then Nan touched her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Dr. Prescott,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there it is,
our ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, there ahead of them, riding
proudly in the dock was their boat, the S.&nbsp;S.
Lincoln. But before they could reach it, before
Bess could place her foot on the gang-plank as
she had been seeing herself do for weeks past, in
imagination a familiar voice cried excitedly,
&ldquo;Here they are! Here they all are!&rdquo; and they
looked up into the faces of mothers and fathers
and friends who had come to see them off.</p>

<p>Immediately the whole rush of the outside
world was forgotten. Nan was in Momsy Sherwood&rsquo;s
arms. Rhoda was kissing her father. Amelia
was assuring hers that her watch was running
perfectly. Laura was off to one side talking to
her mother. Grace was telling her folks all about
the trip from Lakeview. Bess was declaring to
her mother that she had her keys&mdash;safe. There
were introductions all round and then the group
made its way up the gang plank, proudly and
happily and a little bit tearfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan Sherwood&mdash;Miss Nan Sherwood&mdash;&mdash;Nan
Sherwood&mdash;&rdquo; Gradually the fact that Nan&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
name was being called sifted through the minds
of the happy crowd. It was Bess who noticed it
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, why, Nan, they&rsquo;re calling your name,&rdquo;
she tried to get her friend&rsquo;s attention. At last Nan
looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A telegram for Miss Nan Sherwood,&rdquo; the
boy called again. Nan reached through the crowd
for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Elizabeth Harley&mdash;Miss Harley,&rdquo; the
boy began calling again. So, one by one, the girls
received letters and telegrams, cards and flowers
and books, candy and fruit, gifts and messages
from friends in Florida and Chicago and Michigan
and the West where Rhoda lived, wishing
them &ldquo;A Safe Journey and a Happy Landing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because of all the excitement, it was not until
the cry rang out &ldquo;All&rsquo;s ashore that&rsquo;s going
ashore,&rdquo; that Momsy and Papa Sherwood were
able to warn Nan. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Papa Sherwood said,
&ldquo;Remember, there are&mdash;as I have told you before
those at Emberon who might want to do
you harm. Some there have never become reconciled
to your mother&rsquo;s having inherited the fortune.
They might try to make trouble for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Nan herself looked serious
as she answered her father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be most
careful.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Careful, did you say?&rdquo; Bess was at her side.
&ldquo;Why Mrs. Sherwood, of course we&rsquo;ll be careful.
We&rsquo;ll all be very careful.&rdquo; Then as she noted the
serious expression on both Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood&rsquo;s
face, she stopped short. Bess looked puzzled.
Somewhere in the back of her mind there was
something unsolved that this reminded her of.
She tried to remember, but couldn&rsquo;t. It troubled
her vaguely even as she kissed Mrs. Sherwood
good-by. Then she forgot it, for Nan was laughing
and smiling and telling her mother and dad to
hurry and get off if they didn&rsquo;t want to be taken
along too.</p>

<p>Next, they were all standing at the ship&rsquo;s rail,
waving with hats and handkerchiefs to the crowds
on shore. The ship&rsquo;s orchestra was playing one
last tune. Tugs pushed at the boat. Slowly and
majestically, it moved away from the dock to the
harbor and the open sea, carrying Nan Sherwood
and her Lakeview Hall friends along with it.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>TROUBLE FOR NAN</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; Bess was feeling a little forlorn
as the big ship gathered steam and the figures on
shore faded away to nothing.</p>

<p>Nan turned. She had been watching the white
sea gulls swooping in great arcs down over the
boat, missing it, and turning to swoop again. It
looked like such fun!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but
let&rsquo;s go and find out.&rdquo; She took Bess&rsquo;s hand and
went inside, down the elevator, through a long
corridor toward their cabins.</p>

<p>Midway, they were stopped by a white jacketed
steward. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss,&rdquo; he addressed
Bess, &ldquo;but are you Miss Sherwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess couldn&rsquo;t find her tongue. Nan spoke up.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nan Sherwood,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Is there anything
wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many pieces of baggage did you have?&rdquo;
he answered her question with another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Nan answered quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small trunk and a suitcase.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The color?&rdquo; He was making notations on a
small slip of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have them sent to storage or directly
to your cabin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were they properly tagged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought so,&rdquo; Nan was completely
baffled at the questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cabin number?&rdquo; He smiled at the girl
now. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been some confusion,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and one of the other passengers is quite excited
about it. I&rsquo;m trying to straighten out the difficulties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;648. I thought my baggage was in my cabin.&rdquo;
Nan <em>was</em> puzzled now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; Bess chimed in. &ldquo;Your
father and my father came down and checked on
that to make sure before they got off the boat.
I&rsquo;m certain they said your baggage was there.
Come let&rsquo;s look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls and the steward continued down
the corridor to the cabins where the rest of the
Lakeview crowd was already at work unpacking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, here they are now.&rdquo; Rhoda looked up as
the two girls entered. &ldquo;We were just wondering
about you. The angriest looking red-headed man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
we&rsquo;ve ever seen was just here demanding to see
Miss Sherwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was near-sighted and slightly hunch-backed,&rdquo;
Laura continued. &ldquo;He lifted his shoulders,
puckered his brows, and peered at Rhoda as
though she was either hiding you in this cabin or
lying when she said that she didn&rsquo;t know where
you were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked slowly around,&rdquo; Grace contributed,
&ldquo;as though you must surely be here. I thought for
a moment that he was going to open the cabinet.
But he hesitated and just stared at it. I&rsquo;m sure he
looked right through those doors and saw that
you weren&rsquo;t there.&rdquo; She shuddered as she remembered
the man&rsquo;s expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and when Rhoda advanced toward that
doorway, easing him gently out, you know,&rdquo; Amelia
too looked frightened, &ldquo;his face got so red
that I thought he was going to die of apoplexy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then all of a sudden he changed,&rdquo; Rhoda
took up the story again. &ldquo;He begged our pardon,
said there was some confusion about baggage, and
went away to find a steward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan turned to the steward at her side. &ldquo;Is that
the man whose baggage you are enquiring about?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answers the description perfectly, Miss.&rdquo; He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was all politeness. &ldquo;If you will pardon me now, I
would like to see your luggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other girls moved to one side and attempted
to get their scattered belongings out of
the way. The cabin was small, and they had not yet
finished unpacking. Laura and Amelia, whose cabin
was across the corridor left&mdash;reluctantly.</p>

<p>The steward stepped over the other bags in the
room and went directly to Nan&rsquo;s trunk. He looked
at it carefully, turned it over, and examined the
tag. Finally, he looked up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss Sherwood,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;The porters have made a mistake.
This luggage was meant for room 846 instead
of 648. See.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan stepped over the luggage, as he had done,
and looked at the tag. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, more
puzzled than ever, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t my luggage. I can
see now that it isn&rsquo;t quite the same color, though
it is the same size and shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is yours?&rdquo; Bess asked the question
that was on the tip of Nan&rsquo;s tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it presently.&rdquo; The steward picked
up the bag and walked out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the great mystery been solved,&rdquo; Laura
asked as she and Amelia came back into the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, partly,&rdquo; Nan said slowly, for she was
still puzzled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how Papa made such a
mistake. I don&rsquo;t understand this yet.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You would understand it even less, if you
have seen the villain in the piece,&rdquo; Laura volunteered.
She liked mysteries. &ldquo;If I were in your
shoes,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t venture out
of this cabin at any time during the crossing and
I wouldn&rsquo;t let a morsel of food cross my lips until
some one had tasted it. At night, I&rsquo;d lock that
porthole and bar the door, and I&rsquo;d never stay
alone for a second. You&rsquo;re in danger, lass.&rdquo; She
shook her head sadly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a deep, deep plot,&rdquo;
she added, as she saw that Bess seemed to be believing
every single word of what she was saying,
&ldquo;to do away with you. Only the utmost caution
will ever get you over this Atlantic Ocean alive.&rdquo;
Her voice was deep and husky as she finished the
sentence, and her eyes stared ahead as though
she could see into the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura, be still,&rdquo; Nan laughed at her friend.
&ldquo;You have Bess believing you now, and if you are
not careful, she&rsquo;ll be seeing hunch-backed men disappearing
into every cabin along that corridor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess said nothing. Her busy mind was remembering
Papa Sherwood&rsquo;s warning just before he
left the boat. &ldquo;There are those at Emberon,&rdquo; he
had said, &ldquo;that might want to do you harm. Be
careful!&rdquo; Again, as then, she had a vague feeling
that there was something that had happened in
the past, something strange and mysterious, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
she ought to remember. Again, it eluded her.</p>

<p>She shook herself, partly in annoyance, partly
to bring herself back to the present and cabin
648. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully slow in bringing that baggage,
isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Amelia looked at her watch. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s been
gone fifteen minutes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Maybe you
had better ring for another steward, Nan. There
is something queer about all of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do!&rdquo; Grace urged. &ldquo;I feel rather
frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there is no sense in getting all worked up
over nothing.&rdquo; Nan was the only one who really
appeared calm. &ldquo;Baggage often gets mixed in the
boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, will you please stop being calm, and do
something?&rdquo; Bess was working herself up into a
real frenzy. &ldquo;Maybe someone has stolen your
luggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to wear my clothes and will
you ever be a sight!&rdquo; This from Amelia who was
fully two inches taller than Nan and much, much
thinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or mine,&rdquo; This for Laura who was shorter
than Nan, and plumper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you all, but I guess I&rsquo;ll wear my own.&rdquo;
Nan stepped toward the doorway as a steward
knocked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Sherwood?&rdquo; he asked. Nan opened the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why-y-y, yes,&rdquo; she answered, hesitantly, for
it was not the same steward who had taken the
other bag away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your bag, I believe,&rdquo; he half questioned as
he dropped it inside the doorway and left.</p>

<p>The girls could hardly wait until they had
examined it. The number on the tag was wrong
just as the mysterious visitor had said, and the
bag did look much like the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, get your keys!&rdquo; It was Laura speaking.
&ldquo;It looks to me as though this lock has been
meddled with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; Nan opened her purse.</p>

<p>The six girls all stooped over the bag, as
Laura tried the key. &ldquo;Oh, that isn&rsquo;t the right
one.&rdquo; She was impatient at the delay.</p>

<p>Nan handed her another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, will you all move round so I have
more light?&rdquo; Laura asked. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t seem to
fit, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood up and watched her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong, Nan.&rdquo; Laura moved to
one side. &ldquo;Here, you try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan took the key, fussed with the lock a second,
pushing and pulling, until finally the case
flew open.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>BESS HOLDS HER TEMPER</small></h2>


<p>Nan said nothing, but sat staring at the contents,
a puzzled expression on her face. The girls
looked from the trunk to Nan and back to the
trunk again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is all right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Bess asked
the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;know.&rdquo; Nan answered slowly
and doubtfully. &ldquo;Everything seems to be as I left
it. Yet somehow it&rsquo;s all changed too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Grace questioned
timidly.</p>

<p>Nan looked up from her place on the floor into
the anxious faces of the girls around her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as
baffled as you are,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really
tell whether anyone has touched the things in my
trunk or not. The underwear&mdash;slips&mdash;stockings&mdash;blouses&rdquo;
she touched each pile of things as she
named it,&mdash;&ldquo;pajamas, and even the dresses, are
folded the same and in the same places as they
were when I packed. I&rsquo;m sure of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, when that case flew open, I had a peculiar
feeling that someone besides myself had been
through it and touched everything there.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo; Bess shuddered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say things like
that, Nan. They give me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Grace was really pale. &ldquo;Especially
when I remember the expression on that hunchback&rsquo;s
face when he asked for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo; Rhoda
inquired. Generally calm, Rhoda was seriously
worried now. The red-headed man had looked
mean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what are you going to do?&rdquo; Bess repeated
the question. She was more troubled than
any of the rest, because she had more reason than
they to be suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Nan,&rdquo; Amelia urged, as Nan sat, silently
considering. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls, I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; Nan
finally burst forth. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be reported. The
whole thing would sound silly. The purser would
probably pat us on the back, tell us to be good,
and warn us not to read so many detective stories.
I&rsquo;m afraid that there is just nothing to do but keep
quiet and see what happens next, if anything.
After all, it might have been a very innocent
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura snickered. &ldquo;I only hope no innocent mistakes
come walking into my cabin,&rdquo; she said. Then
she grew serious. &ldquo;Really, Nan, I&rsquo;m not generally
a fraidy-cat, but if I were you, I would be careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and watch out for red-headed men. I can&rsquo;t for the
life of me see why anyone in the world would be
after you, but strange things do happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be careful,&rdquo; Nan agreed. &ldquo;Now, I wonder
what that gong was I heard a few minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls, girls, girls!&rdquo; It was Dr. Prescott at the
doorway. &ldquo;What have you been doing? Don&rsquo;t you
know that the second gong for dinner has rung
and that if you don&rsquo;t hurry you won&rsquo;t get anything
to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to eat! And me so starved after the
whiffs I&rsquo;ve been getting of the fresh salt air.&rdquo;
Laura was up and out of the room before she
had finished the sentence. Amelia followed after.
Ten minutes later the girls were headed down the
corridor to the ship&rsquo;s dining room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got your ticket?&rdquo; Nan asked as she
held up a little red card that resembled the seat
stubs in a theatre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ticket, what ticket?&rdquo; Laura stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ticket for your place in the dining room.&rdquo;
Bess was proud of this bit of knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I never had one,&rdquo; Laura declared.
&ldquo;They never even gave me one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes they did,&rdquo; Bess assured her. &ldquo;Remember,
after the purser looked at our passports when
we came aboard ship, he sent us to a window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
where the dining room steward was sitting. The
steward had a plan of the dining room before
him, with all the tables pictured on it. He looked
at us and at our passports and then gave us this
little stub. Remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura looked perfectly blank. &ldquo;What will I
do now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you take mine,&rdquo; Bess was feeling generous.
&ldquo;Since I know just where to go, I&rsquo;ll go up
and get another. You all start eating, though.
Don&rsquo;t wait for me.&rdquo; With this she was off to the
purser&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Laura.&rdquo; Nan took Laura&rsquo;s arm as
the girl hesitated wondering whether, if, after all,
she shouldn&rsquo;t get her own ticket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, or we won&rsquo;t get anything to eat.&rdquo; Amelia
was slightly impatient. &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s hurry. There
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anybody else around at all. Do
you know where the dining room is?&rdquo; she turned
to Nan with the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up on Deck B. I
looked in when I first came down to our cabin.
Just follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was music as the girls hurried up the
stairway and in through wide double doors.
&ldquo;Looks like a hotel dining room,&rdquo; Grace whispered
as the chief steward came toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your stubs, please?&rdquo; he asked and then escorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
them to a big round table in the center of
the room, a table all their own, perfectly set for
seven people.</p>

<p>There was a low bowl of flowers in the center
and a card which read,</p>

<p class="note">
<span class="note1">&ldquo;To Nan Sherwood,</span><br />
<span class="note2">S.&nbsp;S. Lincoln,</span><br />
<span class="note3">c/o Chief Steward.</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;May each day of your journey be more exciting
and more pleasant than the one past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it from, Nan?&rdquo; Even Dr. Prescott was
eager to know. She had been sitting at the table
waiting for the girls to appear.</p>

<p>Nan turned the card over. &ldquo;Why, how nice!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;and how thoughtful!&rdquo; Then she
looked up at Dr. Prescott and the girls waiting at
their places. &ldquo;It is from a famous movie actress,&rdquo;
she said rather shyly, and her face was all aglow,
&ldquo;whom I met once in Chicago. She&rsquo;s a perfectly
grand person.&rdquo; Nan was silent as the details of
that meeting rushed through her mind, as she remembered
how an unfortunate encounter with
Linda had brought it about. As she sat down, she
wondered idly whether the summer holidays that
were before her would be as exciting as those
winter holidays, spent in Chicago at Grace&rsquo;s home,
had been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to Elizabeth?&rdquo; Dr. Prescott
asked as she picked up her menu. &ldquo;Not sea-sick
already, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; Nan laughed. &ldquo;Bess is too busy
being an ocean traveller to even have time to think
of such a thing. Really, Dr. Prescott,&rdquo; Nan
leaned across the table and said earnestly, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t imagine what a kick we are getting out of
all of this. It&rsquo;s like something girls do in story
books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the journey has just begun.&rdquo; Dr. Prescott
smiled at her young charges. &ldquo;It all brings my
first trip&mdash;I was a little older than you are now&mdash;back
to me most vividly. Now, what will we have
to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h, will you look at this menu,&rdquo; Laura
spoke up now. &ldquo;Not much like one of Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
she stopped suddenly and blushed. It was
hard to remember that Dr. Prescott, the head of
Lakeview Hall, was present. Laura looked up
over the top of her menu, ready to apologize. But
Dr. Prescott seemed not to have heard. She
seemed wholly occupied in choosing the mid-day
meal. &ldquo;What a brick she is!&rdquo; Laura thought to
herself as she, too, turned to the business at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just one warning,&rdquo; Dr. Prescott cautioned
before the girls turned to the table steward to
give him their orders. &ldquo;You eat about six times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a day on the boat&mdash;&rdquo; She paused as the girls
gasped. &ldquo;You have a big breakfast, bouillon and
wafers in the middle of the morning, lunch, tea
and cakes in the afternoon, dinner, and then
before you go to bed, there are sandwiches and
perhaps something warm to drink. If you are going
to eat each time,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have
to be careful. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be spending the
hours in your stateroom. There,&rdquo; she finished,
&ldquo;that is my only lecture for the day. Now, do as
you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they chose&mdash;carefully, except Laura, who
could not resist having both French pastry and
ice-cream for desert. &ldquo;Bess will never forgive me,&rdquo;
she spoke up after she had ordered, &ldquo;if she doesn&rsquo;t
get here in time for this first meal on the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ought to be here any time now,&rdquo; Amelia
looked at her watch. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take long to get
your table card. You don&rsquo;t suppose they lock the
dining room doors when everyone is in and that
they won&rsquo;t let her through now?&rdquo; she directed
the question to Dr. Prescott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I hardly think so.&rdquo; Dr. Prescott smiled.
&ldquo;People are coming and going all the time, you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess will get here. Never fear.&rdquo; Nan spoke up
confidently. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat. She told us not to wait.&rdquo;
As the lunch progressed, however, from soup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
through a dainty salad and slices of cold chicken
to dessert, Nan grew uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange that she doesn&rsquo;t appear,&rdquo; she
finally admitted, and was about to leave the dining
room and go in search of her when Bess was
ushered to the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to be so late,&rdquo; Bess murmured as she
sat down and unfolded her napkin, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t
help it.&rdquo; Her face was flushed. She looked confused
and angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say anything now,&rdquo; she begged
as Nan was about to speak. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll make
a scene, if you do, but if ever I see that girl
again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped short as the steward presented
her with a menu.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>A SCORE TO EVEN UP</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Now tell us what happened!&rdquo; The Lakeview
girls were reclining in deck chairs on the sun deck
in the late afternoon. Dr. Prescott was in her
stateroom, making it more presentable, she said,
so it was the first opportunity to talk over Bess&rsquo;
experience.</p>

<p>Bess raised herself up and tucked the steamer
rug more securely around her legs. The April
breezes were fresh, and rather chilly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It still makes me mad,&rdquo; she fumed as she
yanked the rug around further. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go
anyplace, not even across the ocean, but what that
girl turns up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What girl?&rdquo; Laura feigned innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linda Riggs, of course.&rdquo; Bess was utterly
disgusted. &ldquo;When I left you down in the corridor,
I went straight up to the steward&rsquo;s window. I took
my place in line with others, paying no attention
to anyone. All I cared about was getting my ticket
and getting down to the dining room. I moved
along in line like the others and was just about
ready to show the steward my passport, when
someone gave me a shove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t going to stand for that, so I
stood my ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; Nan interpreted, &ldquo;that you
shoved right back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you want to call a little push that,
yes,&rdquo; Bess admitted. &ldquo;But if I&rsquo;d known who it
was, I would have knocked her down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bess!&rdquo; Nan was horrified and amused.
&ldquo;You little beast! I&rsquo;m surprised at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always getting us into trouble.&rdquo; Bess
was indignant all over again. &ldquo;There I was, minding
my own business, thinking nice thoughts, and
having quite a perfect time. No one was farther
from my concern than she. And what happens?
She walks right into me, pushes me aside, never
begs my pardon, and presents her passport first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what did you do?&rdquo; Laura asked. She
was as amused as Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could I do?&rdquo; Bess inquired sharply. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t fight with her there in front of all those
people. She had the advantage and knew it. She&rsquo;s
the most unfair person I&rsquo;ve ever come across. I
hate her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that all that happened?&rdquo; Laura was reluctant
to let the subject drop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All! Wasn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo; Bess exploded
again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes.&rdquo; Laura admitted. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you
know anything more about her. Did you leave
right away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Bess answered resentfully.
&ldquo;How could I? I didn&rsquo;t even have my check yet
for the table. There wasn&rsquo;t anything to do,&rdquo; she
added regretfully, &ldquo;except to take a place behind
her in line and listen to her make her demands of
the steward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we are getting someplace,&rdquo; Laura leaned
forward as Bess let drop this piece of information.
&ldquo;What did you find out about her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan shook her head at this line of conversation.
She did not approve of eavesdropping. But
no one paid any attention to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it makes me angry all over again to think
of it,&rdquo; Bess jerked at the steamer rug again. &ldquo;As
I said before, she didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to me.
I might have been just anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave the steward her passport, stepped
back slightly, almost treading on my feet, and
looked at him through a lorget&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean lorgnette,&rdquo; Laura interrupted, &ldquo;but
it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lorgnette, then,&rdquo; Bess corrected. &ldquo;Anyway,
she looked at the steward through it as though
he had been put there just to do as she ordered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as though he was a puppet that she could dangle
as she wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how she does it in that stuck-up way
of hers. Why, if I had been him, I would have
thrown the plans right in her face. But he was
just as meek as I am before Mrs. Cupp, the fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, do be careful,&rdquo; Nan put a restraining
hand over her mouth, &ldquo;other people will hear
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess lowered her voice as she went on. &ldquo;She
told him that he had made a mistake, a perfectly
dreadful mistake. Devastating, I think, was the
word she used&mdash;whatever that means. At any
rate, he had given her a stub for a table down here
in Tourist Class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, my dears, Linda Riggs,&rdquo; Bess mimicked
Linda&rsquo;s voice as she continued, &ldquo;the daughter of
the great railway magnate, never has anything but
the best, the very best, when she travels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Nan hooted. She was remembering her
own encounter with Linda at the travel agent&rsquo;s
a few weeks previously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; Laura wanted more about this
exciting encounter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he begged her pardon. Can you imagine
that?&rdquo; Bess looked at her friends for an answer.
There was none. &ldquo;Gave her a new stub, asked her
if there was anything else he could do for her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
all but personally escorted her back to First
Class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even thank him for his trouble. She
just turned, looked some of the people up and down
as though they were curiosities in a zoo, and
swept over to the elevator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? She didn&rsquo;t walk on you again,&rdquo; Laura
was purposely baiting Bess now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; Bess answered emphatically.
&ldquo;Before she turned, I stepped way back so
that there wasn&rsquo;t any more danger of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Bess,&rdquo; Rhoda now spoke up for
the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Nan grinned impishly as she
thought about it, &ldquo;That one or two of us made a
New Year&rsquo;s resolution about Linda Riggs. Remember
Bess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, why should I remember?&rdquo; Bess
asked. &ldquo;I never in all this wide world made a
resolution about Linda, unless it was to get even
with her for the times she has embarrassed us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Bess,&rdquo; Nan pursued her train of
thought, &ldquo;You remember how, after the New
Year&rsquo;s Eve party at Grace&rsquo;s, we went up to our
room and made resolutions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did.&rdquo; Bess corrected her abruptly and
very positively. &ldquo;You and Grace said that for one
month you would be nice to Linda, no matter what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
happened. Then Linda never did come back to
school, so it didn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Nan attempted to dismiss the unpleasant
subject, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why she
should bother us. She&rsquo;s up in First Class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;re down here in Tourist.&rdquo; It was
a sore point with Bess, who was always irritated
when Linda was able to show her superiority in
money matters. Bess wanted most intensely to be
able to look down on Linda. She wanted to have
something so much better than Linda that the
arrogant girl would envy her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; Nan resolved as she rose from her
deck chair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let her spoil my trip.
Come,&rdquo; she half coaxed, &ldquo;Come, Bess, let&rsquo;s all
take a turn about deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Grace encouraged, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
walk once, clear around the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Laura supplied the information,
as she looked at Bess, &ldquo;You can walk only
so far and then there&rsquo;s a gate that separates you
from first class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, forget it!&rdquo; Nan looked reprovingly at
Laura. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she invited again. &ldquo;I
know a place where you can stoop under some
rigging and come out on a little part of the deck
that&rsquo;s almost like a balcony with the ocean below
it and nothing but the sky above.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I know a place,&rdquo; Rhoda contributed,
&ldquo;where you can get way up front, so that you are
at the prow of the boat. When you stand there,
you feel as though you yourself are cutting
through the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mermaid at large.&rdquo; Laura laughed. &ldquo;I know
that place, too. I found it right after lunch and
thought, until now, that it was my private
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I know a place that&rsquo;s even better than
that,&rdquo; Grace boasted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a large room with
portholes all along both ends. There are tables in
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And tea and cakes for all who come,&rdquo; Laura
finished. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went, but neither tea nor cakes could
make Bess forget that she had a score to even up
with Linda.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>FRIENDS ABOARD SHIP</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Hello, down there!&rdquo; Nan stretched her head
over the edge of her berth and looked down to the
bunk below where Bess was still sleeping. &ldquo;Hello,
I say,&rdquo; she repeated a little louder when the first
call brought no response. Then she waited. She
could feel the vibration of the great ship as it
forged ahead and hear faintly the steady throb
of its engines. It was nice to be getting someplace,
she thought, even while you were asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Nan called again. &ldquo;You awake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess rubbed her eyes and leaned out so she
could see Nan above. &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;How long have you been awake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for hours and hours,&rdquo; Nan responded. &ldquo;I
heard the first gong for breakfast and then the
second. After that I went back to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t either!&rdquo; Bess was really awake
now. &ldquo;But if you did,&rdquo; she continued half hopefully,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late to get breakfast in the dining-room,
so we&rsquo;ll just have to ring that bell over
there by the door and ask the stewardess to bring
our breakfast to the cabin. Just think of being able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to order anything you want and having it brought
to you on a big tray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess stretched luxuriously and then turned over
on her side. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I feel like a
movie queen. My pajamas are of satin and fine
lace. My robe is long and trailing with marabou
around the neck. These bed covers are made of
silk and down, and your bunk up there is not really
a bunk. It&rsquo;s the canopy of my bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan looked over the side. &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
she asked as though she hadn&rsquo;t heard.</p>

<p>Bess started to repeat, &ldquo;Your bunk is the canopy&rdquo;&mdash;but
didn&rsquo;t finish, for Nan was up and on
her way down the ladder which stretched from
the floor to her upper berth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep any longer on this canopy,&rdquo; she
laughed. &ldquo;Moreover, I&rsquo;m starved and a tray
would never hold all I&rsquo;m going to eat this morning.
You may stay here, my movie queen, and eat
daintily from a tray while your back is propped
comfortably against pillows. I want bacon and
eggs,&rdquo; she finished, as she opened the wardrobe at
the end of the berths and took out a skirt and
bright sweater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may spend your morning in the cabin,&rdquo;
she went on, washing and dressing the while, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m going out on the deck and see what&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;
She combed her hair before the mirror over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
washstands and sat down at a small dressing table
while she tied a three-cornered scarf around her
head. With a small hand mirror, she looked at it
from all sides, and then pulled a wisp of hair out
at the front and looked again. Satisfied, she put
the mirror down, blew a kiss to her lazy chum,
and was off.</p>

<p>Not waiting for the elevator, she walked up the
stairs, opened a door, and stepped out. The morning
sun was already high above the horizon, and
the deck was bright with its light. Nan squinted
her eyes. Then, as she became accustomed to the
dazzle and opened them wide, she saw approaching
her a merry looking, pleasant person, the
ship&rsquo;s hostess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;&rdquo; the stranger paused and smiled at
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan Sherwood.&rdquo; With this Nan was introduced
to a group of young people her own age.</p>

<p>First, there was Hetty Warren, a young English
girl whom Nan liked right away. She had
blond hair and blue eyes and a complexion even
fairer than that of most English girls. She had,
she told Nan a little wistfully, just left her parents
in Washington, where her father was a member
of the English Embassy. Her grandmother
was taking her back to London to witness an event
which she said, no grandchild of hers would ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
miss, the crowning of the new King and Queen.</p>

<p>Then, there was Jeanie MacFarland, a brown-eyed
Scotch lass whose father, she said proudly,
was on the Edinburgh committee to buy a gift for
the king. And Maureen O&rsquo;Grady, Irish as her
name, headed first for home and then for London.
Her mother was helping to make the lace for
the Queen&rsquo;s train.</p>

<p>Oh, they all had stories, these girls. One had
lived once in far away India, in Bombay. Another,
in the British colony in Shanghai. The father of
one was a caretaker at the King&rsquo;s favorite castle
and the brother of another, a lieutenant in His
Majesty&rsquo;s Fleet stationed at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>They were coming from all corners of the
world, Nan found, to be in England in May, to
see the King and Queen parade in a golden coach
from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Cathedral,
to attend the balls and the garden parties
and the Colonial fairs, to see the King review the
British fleet at Spithead and hear the crowds cheer
the pretty little princess at her party for the English
school children. Everyone, young and old,
Hetty&rsquo;s grandmother said, was to have a part in
the joyous week.</p>

<p>School children throughout the Empire were to
have seven days of vacation. &ldquo;Boy Scouts from
Australia and India and British South Africa are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
even now,&rdquo; she told Nan, &ldquo;coming on boats to act
as a special guard for the little prince. Others, in
England and Scotland have charge of the tremendously
big bonfires that will be lighted on
each hilltop the night after the king and queen are
crowned. These beacon fires will proclaim to
everyone that a new King and Queen have come
to the throne. And, with the lighting of the fires,
the people all over the British Empire will sing
&lsquo;God Save the King.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the Girl Scouts,&rdquo; Hetty went on,
&ldquo;are having a big party in the gardens of Buckingham
Palace. The little princess will be there
and the Queen too. A thousand poor children have
been invited and the princess has a gift for each
one. They have a gift for the princess too, and
one for the Queen. Oh, I can hardly wait until the
big day arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; Jeanie contributed, &ldquo;All over Scotland,
the wee lassies and laddies have each given a tuppence
piece to their school teachers. When the King
and Queen come to Edinburgh after the golden
crowns have been put on their heads, all this
money will be put in a golden bag and presented
to the Queen. Her Majesty will use it to help the
children whose fathers were killed in the wars.
An orphan from one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s orphanages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
will present it at a banquet which the Lord
Mayor will give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be there?&rdquo; Nan was wide-eyed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only could.&rdquo; Jeanie&rsquo;s voice was full of
longing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we only could,&rdquo; Hetty echoed the statement
and included everybody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not for the likes of us,&rdquo; Maureen
shook her head as everyone fell silent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for
the great ladies, they who live up in the castles on
the hills and in the palaces in the cities. They
were born to such things. No, it&rsquo;s not for the likes
of us,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Maureen,&rdquo; Hetty said earnestly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Don&rsquo;t say it isn&rsquo;t for the likes of
us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hetty&rsquo;s grandmother smiled at the seriousness
of her grand-daughter. &ldquo;Hetty is remembering,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;the time the Queen stopped at our country
cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you there?&rdquo; The girls all looked at
Hetty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was before she was born,&rdquo; the bright-eyed
old lady went on. &ldquo;It was back in the days of
the good Queen Victoria before people drove
around in gasoline buggies.&rdquo; She stopped as
though she had finished, but Nan saw a twinkle in
her eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Please go on,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Please tell us all
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Grandmother,&rdquo; Hetty laughed, &ldquo;you
know you want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady ruffled her grand-daughter&rsquo;s hair
playfully, as she continued, &ldquo;We were sitting in
the kitchen, my mother and I. She, like the model
housewife she was, God bless her soul, was scouring
pots and pans and giving me a few instructions
on the proper behavior of a young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mind what I say about your curiosity,&rsquo; she
was telling me, when a crash outside interrupted.
She dropped everything, making such a clatter as
I&rsquo;ve never heard since and nearly fell over me in
her anxiety to get to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Glory be!&rsquo; I heard her exclaim and ran after
her. There, in front of the house a big coach had
broken down. Two coachmen had climbed down
from their high seats and were helping three
ladies out the door and up the path to our house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother whisked off her blue checked
apron, smoothed down her hair and opened the
door. I stood back&mdash;afrighted, as the three grand
ladies came into the front parlor. Then I disappeared
back into the kitchen. Mother made tea
and gave them shortbread and was so a-flutter
herself that she broke one of her company dishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wanted to pay for it, but she wouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
let them. She said it was nothing at all. After
they went, I saw her wiping a tear out of her
eye and she scoured the pans harder than she ever
scoured them before. That night she told my
father that she was never going to pay any attention
to any big coaches again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But weeks later when another big coach
stopped in front of the house, she was at the door
again. This time a man came and left a big box.
Mother said it wasn&rsquo;t for her, but he insisted it
was. Finally, she accepted it, and he had hardly
driven away, before she and I were opening it.&rdquo;
The old lady paused here to enjoy the eager faces
of the young girls around her. Then she cleared
her throat and went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside we found a dozen dainty cups and
saucers and a card. Our visitors had been two
princesses and Her Majesty, Queen Victoria!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And great-grandmother always said,&rdquo; Hetty
added, &ldquo;that the great Queen herself painted the
cups. So, Maureen,&rdquo; she ended triumphantly, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t know, really, what there is for the likes of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; her grandmother agreed, &ldquo;so
make the most of today. Now, begone with you
all, and gather up the news of the ship and bring
it all back to me. There are many strange people
aboard,&rdquo; she ended, closing her eyes and so dismissing
the girls.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A STORM AT SEA</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;How strange the sky looks!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed.
She and her Lakeview Hall companions were
standing on deck watching the sun drop below the
horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How cold!&rdquo; Grace added, as she pulled her
coat around her, held it in place with her hand,
and then huddled closer to Nan as if for protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-a-and the wind!&rdquo; Rhoda supplied, with
difficulty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s l-l-lashing at me so that I can&rsquo;t&mdash;get&mdash;my
breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor&mdash;me&mdash;&mdash;either.&rdquo; Amelia gasped. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I
guess the Captain was right after all.
He said, there was going to be a heavy gale tonight.
Come, let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stay just a minute longer,&rdquo; Nan pleaded.
&ldquo;I like to see it roll. Look, see how the fish are
jumping the waves! They are coming in higher
and higher all the time. I wonder how this boat
behaves when there is a real storm at sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the sailors told me this morning,&rdquo;
Laura volunteered, &ldquo;that &lsquo;she&rsquo;s a trusty old tub&rsquo;,
if that will comfort you any.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t need comforting,&rdquo; Nan replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to say you wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid in a
storm?&rdquo; Grace asked incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; Nan answered. &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the answer to that later,&rdquo; Grace
threw over her shoulder as she made for the
doors to go in. &ldquo;Just now I&rsquo;d rather watch this
from the windows in the lounge where it&rsquo;s warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in, in a second,&rdquo; Amelia called after
her, &ldquo;Save a place for us. Have you people seen
the ship&rsquo;s log?&rdquo; She went on, turning to Nan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
posted inside, near the elevators. There is a map
of the United States, the Atlantic Ocean, and
Europe with the course of our voyage marked in
little lines on it. Each day the purser sticks a flag,
representing our ship on this line, so that it shows
where we are and how far we have traveled during
the day. Underneath, there is a little weather
chart telling how fast the wind is going, what the
temperature is, whether or not the sea is rolling,
and what might be expected for the next twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it say for today,&rdquo; Nan asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The temperature is dropping&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know that,&rdquo; Laura interrupted. &ldquo;What
else does it say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the sea is slightly rolling.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We can feel that,&rdquo; Laura put in again, for
the ship was rolling with the waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we are headed into a storm. There, Miss
Smarty, you didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Amelia laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did too,&rdquo; Laura retorted. &ldquo;My creaking
bones told me. Now, I&rsquo;m going in before I get
rheumatism.&rdquo; So saying, she followed Grace. The
others, except Nan, whom not even Bess could
persuade to come in as yet, followed her.</p>

<p>Alone on the dark deck, Nan stood for a while
at the rail, watching the white foam of the waves,
listening to the roar of the wind, and glancing now
and then at the clouds, swiftly gathering overhead.
Save for a pale moon, the only light was
the ship&rsquo;s beacon which every few seconds, passed
in its circle, over Nan&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Once, Nan was tempted to follow her friends.
She could hear voices, singing and laughter, and
the sound of a piano inside. She even started toward
the door, but then a dark passageway at
her right tempted her and she went exploring.</p>

<p>Hugging the side of the boat closely, she followed
around through the passageway between
the ship&rsquo;s riggings, and then on down the deck
until she came to the barrier between first and
second class that Laura had taunted Bess about.
She examined it carefully. It was impossible to get
by. There was no moving it. She tried sliding it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and pushing it. It wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</p>

<p>She turned and retraced her steps, going back
to some narrow iron stairs that went up. The
&ldquo;Keep Off&rdquo; sign, which she couldn&rsquo;t read in the
dark, she shoved aside. She was determined now
to make a complete circle of the boat. She went
up the stairs, around another deck, and down
some steps again.</p>

<p>This was becoming a real adventure and Nan
was enjoying every minute of it. If her conscience
troubled her at all, she paid no heed. Others on
the boat had told her of going out of bounds, and
she could see no real harm in it.</p>

<p>She walked around deckchairs piled high
against the side of the boat, caught a glimpse of
some phosphorescent fish in the ocean, and walked
over to the rail. How pretty they looked in the
deep black of the water! She stood for a while
watching the colors at play and then went on. It
was almost as though she was motivated by some
force outside herself.</p>

<p>She heard no sounds from people in the boat
now, for she had passed the lounges and the recreation
rooms. She felt almost alone on the boat,
and laughed a little to herself as she thought how
timid Grace would be in such a situation. However,
Nan liked it.</p>

<p>It brought back to her mind nights at Pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Camp. How far away all that seemed now! How
far away it was! Northern Michigan was in another
world. The people there, Aunt Kate, Injun
Pete, Toby Vanderwiller, and Gedney Raffer, all
of them, were like people she had dreamed about.
She shook herself impatiently, driving away some
eerie thoughts, and then went on until she came
to the very back of the vessel, the stern.</p>

<p>Here she stopped, and looked back over the
ocean which the boat was putting behind it. The
wake, the white foamy path of the boat stretched
out as far as she could see. The waters, which
made it, rolled aside in big white waves leaving
the center black and deep.</p>

<p>How much colder it was getting! And how
much rougher! Nan clung to the rail, and held
her head high as the wind whipped her hair back
so that it stung the sides of her cheeks. She
watched the waves coming, each one higher than
the last and angrier. She counted them, &ldquo;One, two,
three,&rdquo; someone had told her once that the seventh
was always the highest, &ldquo;four, five.&rdquo; She
could feel the spray on her face and the air was
full of mist. &ldquo;Six, seven&mdash;why the seventh wasn&rsquo;t
any bigger than any of the rest! And&mdash;eight.&rdquo; It
was the eighth that was the biggest of all! It
climbed up the boat, over the rail, and across the
deck, taking Nan off her feet!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>She lost her balance completely, wrenched her
arm as she fell, and was afraid for a second that
she would go over with the wash of the wave. But
she held on, and as the boat righted itself after
the inundation, Nan rose to her feet, half dazed.</p>

<p>She rubbed her hair out of her eyes, winced with
the pain in her arm, and being very careful now,
started toward the door. She stopped short.</p>

<p>Was that a cry she had heard? She raised her
head, listening attentively for some sound other
than the roaring of the waves. There wasn&rsquo;t any.
She must have imagined it. She went on across the
deck, now shiny after its bath with sea water.
There was something white at her feet. She
stooped to pick it up&mdash;a handkerchief. Again, she
thought she heard a low moan and stopped dead
still.</p>

<p>Yes, there it was again. Nan hesitated, deciding
whether to investigate herself or call for help.
The crash of the waves drowned out everything
and decided Nan. She could hear them coming,
one, two&mdash;what direction had the sound come
from?&mdash;three, four, five. There it was again, over
at her right. She started toward it and lost her
balance, grabbed hold of a flagpole, and then
crept forward. Six&mdash;seven&mdash;it was the seventh
that was the biggest this time, but before it had
struck with its full force Nan&rsquo;s hand reached out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and grabbed the coat of someone lying on the
deck. With her other, as the wave struck, she held
fast to the pole.</p>

<p>There it was, the wave! It came up and over
the two, tugged at them, first their hips, and then
their feet, and finally reluctantly, went on over the
side without them.</p>

<p>Nan screamed, again and again. The form at
her hand seemed to have no life. There was no
answer to her call. She, herself, was weaker, much
weaker than she thought.</p>

<p>She got up slowly and painfully and tried to
pull her burden after her. She couldn&rsquo;t budge it.
She could hear, as from some far off land, the
waves coming again. She shook her head, aware
now that her senses had been dulled. Now, she
could count them again, one, two&mdash;the second
one splashed lightly over the deck. They were
getting higher all the time. Three, four&mdash;Nan
reached down with her strained arm, put it under
the limp form, and half dragged, half carried it
to the door, a partial shelter, as the fifth wave
swept like a fury over the deck.</p>

<p>Nan reached up to open the door. It was
locked. In a frenzy, she beat upon it. It was double
locked against the storm! She knocked it again,
screamed, and then, for the first time in her life,
fainted dead away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>IN THE SHIP&rsquo;S HOSPITAL</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I hope she dies of pneumonia!&rdquo; Bess was
frankly crying as she walked down the corridor
toward the ship&rsquo;s hospital. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like nothing better
than to witness a funeral at sea, if it was Linda
Riggs&rsquo;,&rdquo; she stated most emphatically, and then
wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a cat, that&rsquo;s what she is or she would
have died long ago. Remember,&rdquo; she recalled,
&ldquo;when we planned that surprise party on Nan
back in Lakeview and that black cat came into the
room. That was the soul of Linda Riggs,&rdquo; Bess
vowed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a cat and a witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace looked impressed, but Laura snickered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Bess,&rdquo; Rhoda stopped and put a restraining
hand on Bess&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going
into that hospital room and talk like that before
Nan. She needs rest and quiet. The doctor said so.
Now, are you going to curb your anger, or aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will,&rdquo; Bess answered. &ldquo;Just give me a
couple of seconds to cool off. Every time I think
of Nan risking her life to save that good-for-nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it riles me clear through. Nan&rsquo;s so good to
everyone, and Linda, well, she tramps all over
everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Bess, take it easy,&rdquo; Laura for once
tried to placate the girl. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have any more
trouble from her this trip. The nurse told me
Linda has to stay in bed until the boat docks. If
Nan is careful, she&rsquo;ll be down in her own cabin
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So remember, Bess,&rdquo; Amelia implored, &ldquo;not
to say anything about Linda or about that other
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What other?&rdquo; Bess asked, and then remembered.
&ldquo;Oh, you mean the cabin?&rdquo; she supplied
the answer herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just keep still about everything unpleasant,&rdquo;
Rhoda warned. &ldquo;We want Nan out of here
as soon as possible.&rdquo; With this, she pushed
open the white door of the ship&rsquo;s hospital and a
nurse came forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve came to see Miss Sherwood,&rdquo; she
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rhoda was spokesman for the group.
&ldquo;Is it all right for us all to go in together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nurse looked doubtful a moment, noting
the marks of tears that were still on Bess&rsquo;s cheeks.
Bess felt her glance and blushed. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all
right now,&rdquo; she reassured the nurse. &ldquo;I promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to be good,&rdquo; and she smiled so winningly that the
nurse gave in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you may go in,&rdquo; she said, as she looked
professionally at her watch, &ldquo;for half an hour.
But remember, you are not to disturb the patient.&rdquo;
With this she opened the door to a private room,
and the girls went in.</p>

<p>There, lying in a white hospital bed, looking
pale and very wan, was Nan. She smiled at their
entrance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so
scared. Come in and sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did, and it was a few seconds, a few awkward
seconds, before anyone could think of anything
to say. Twice Bess opened her mouth to
speak, but when her friends looked at her warningly,
she closed it again.</p>

<p>Finally, Rhoda found her voice. &ldquo;Why, Nan,&rdquo;
she asked, and her glance, like that of the other
girls was riveted on a big bouquet of red roses,
&ldquo;where in the world did you get those flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color came back into Nan&rsquo;s cheeks. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
you guess?&rdquo; She grinned rather defiantly at them.
&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t from anyone on the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could anyone on shore know?&rdquo; Bess
already had her suspicions as to the person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he did,&rdquo; Grace was very positive about
the &ldquo;He,&rdquo; &ldquo;How could He send them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Nan, spill it,&rdquo; Laura was as curious as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the rest. &ldquo;Heroines can&rsquo;t have secrets, you know.
Their lives are public property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am afraid of.&rdquo; Nan nodded
from her place among the pillows. &ldquo;However, I
couldn&rsquo;t keep it to myself if I wanted to. They&rsquo;re
from Walter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how&mdash;&rdquo; Bess just couldn&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sent them from shore when the boat was
in dock and asked the steward to keep them until
we were in mid-ocean. They brought them up here
this morning and when I opened my eyes&mdash;there
they were.&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s eyes were shining and her
cheeks were almost as red as the roses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are just gorgeous,&rdquo; Rhoda stooped
over to smell them, &ldquo;so red, and fragrant, and
fresh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they though?&rdquo; Nan reached out and
touched them softly. &ldquo;But tell me now,&rdquo; she
looked up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should know,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;You
are the news around here. Everyone&rsquo;s talking
about you. There are at least a dozen different
versions of what happened last night making the
rounds of this ship. One has it that Linda actually
went over the side of the boat and that you leaped
in and saved her from drowning. Then you caught
hold of a rope, and a sailor, out to see that everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was shipshape, heard your cries, and hauled
the two of you in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another,&rdquo; Amelia said further, as Nan
laughed, &ldquo;has you in a fight with Linda. Oh, I
mean,&rdquo; she corrected herself when Nan looked
worried, &ldquo;that Linda is supposed to have become
so frightened that she didn&rsquo;t know what she was
doing. She tore at your hair and scratched you.
(Here Nan ran her hand over her face. It was
perfectly whole.) Finally, when you realized that
she was beyond reason, you are supposed to have
hit her over the head so hard that you knocked
her out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And another&mdash;&rdquo; Laura began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me any more,&rdquo; Nan shook her
head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m ever going to go
out of here and face all those people. It scares me
to think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry, Nan,&rdquo; Rhoda took her
friend&rsquo;s hand in hers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all rally round.
Everybody, really, is just being grand. I didn&rsquo;t
know there were so many nice people in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo; Nan forgot her embarrassment.
&ldquo;Look at that pile of cards and notes and books
and magazines. Why, I believe all the passengers
on the ship have stopped in to ask about me and
one little boy&rdquo;&mdash;she stopped and giggled before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
she went on&mdash;&ldquo;wanted my autograph! Can you
imagine anything so silly? But tell me, what did
happen? I fainted, didn&rsquo;t I? I don&rsquo;t remember a
thing after I found those doors were locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan,&rdquo; Bess couldn&rsquo;t restrain herself any
longer. &ldquo;Maybe you were there for hours, we
don&rsquo;t know. We only know this: after we left you
out there on deck we all went into the lounge and
talked and played games for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wondered where you were, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
She looked at the others for confirmation. They
nodded their heads as Bess went on, &ldquo;but we
thought that you were probably off somewheres
with that English girl, what is her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Hetty Warren?&rdquo; Nan supplied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. Well, we thought you were with
her and her grandmother until about ten o&rsquo;clock
when we went down to the cabin and met Hetty.
She was bringing a travel book about England to
you. She said she hadn&rsquo;t seen you all evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were worried then, and she went with us
to see whether you were with either Jeanie or
Maureen. They said they hadn&rsquo;t seen you, either.
We didn&rsquo;t know what to do then, so finally we
went to Dr. Beulah. She had been in her cabin all
evening, because she wasn&rsquo;t feeling very well. She
called a steward and he said he would hunt you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
up. He was gone for hours, while we sat in her
cabin and talked and wondered and worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he finally came back, he didn&rsquo;t have any
news! Dr. Beulah got up and dressed then and
called the Captain. He told us all to come up to
his office. We went at once, and he asked a million
questions about you. Then he got busy on the
phone and started a boat-wide search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t any time at all after that when they
called Dr. Beulah and told her to come to the
hospital right away.&rdquo; Here Bess started to cry
again, for she remembered so vividly how frightened
they had all been at that call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess,&rdquo; It was Nan speaking. &ldquo;Come here,
I&rsquo;m so sorry I caused you all that trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Bess grinned through her tears.
&ldquo;Dr. Beulah went up and the first person she saw
there was Linda Riggs. I guess she was pretty
disgusted herself for once, though she would
never say it. Then the nurse took her in to see
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember from then on,&rdquo; Nan continued.
&ldquo;I came to when they were carrying me
here, so that when Dr. Beulah came up I knew
what it was all about. I was only scared for fear
she would give me the scolding I deserved for
going off that way by myself. But she didn&rsquo;t. She
just took me in her arms and kissed me and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
went off and talked to the nurse and doctor. I
don&rsquo;t know what she said or did to them, but they
have been fluttering around me all the time as
though I was a Royal Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you get up!&rdquo; Laura exclaimed.
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll find out who you are.&rdquo; She looked
both merry and mysterious as she said this last.
Nan looked questioningly at her.</p>

<p>But there was no opportunity for any more
talk. The nurse came in, felt Nan&rsquo;s pulse and
smiled at the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, nodding toward the
door. So they got up and left, leaving Nan looking
wistfully after them.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE HUNCH-BACK AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t where our cabin is!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed
the next morning as Bess and Rhoda, one
on each side of her, walked her slowly from the
hospital back to the stateroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, Nan,&rdquo; Rhoda maintained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ours was number 648. It was an outside
cabin.&rdquo; Nan continued to protest. &ldquo;Or have I
gone completely batty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Rhoda teased, &ldquo;though
you do do some pretty strange things sometimes.
However, this is your cabin now and it&rsquo;s not an
outside one. There just wasn&rsquo;t another outside
one free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did I need another? What was wrong
with the one I had? What happened? Please tell
me,&rdquo; she pleaded. The questions tumbled one
after another out of Nan&rsquo;s mouth, for she was
impatient, still somewhat shaken after her frightening
experience during the storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, it&rsquo;s nothing at all,&rdquo; Bess comforted.
&ldquo;That is, I hope it isn&rsquo;t, because it&rsquo;s all my fault,&rdquo;
she added very contritely. &ldquo;It was so warm here
the night of the storm that I opened the porthole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
when I came down to leave my heavy coat. Amelia
called me and told me to hurry and, rattle-brained
as I am, I ran after her completely forgetting
about the storm and the porthole. You can guess
what happened. One of those big waves that
nearly did away with you plopped in and made a
miniature lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was anything ruined?&rdquo; Nan asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, except my own silk dress. Remember,
I threw it down in disgust that afternoon because
the snaps had been pulled off the sleeves.
Well, you should see it now. It&rsquo;s a complete wreck.
Serves me right to have to get along without it.
I only hope you don&rsquo;t feel too disappointed in the
new cabin.&rdquo; Bess looked genuinely troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Nan reassured her friend. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care what kind of a cabin I have,&rdquo; she said
lightly, for such things really didn&rsquo;t matter to
her.</p>

<p>But the words were hardly out of her mouth
when Bess pushed the door open and revealed to
Nan a big stateroom with twin beds, a chaise
longue, two big easy chairs, dainty dressing tables,
a large wardrobe, and a little private sitting
room!</p>

<p>Nan gasped. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t ours,&rdquo; she exclaimed
incredulously.</p>

<p>Rhoda and Bess looked from Nan to the stateroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and back again to Nan. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; they cried.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan stepped into the room and looked around.
The sitting room had big windows overlooking
the deck and the sea. There were books and magazines,
a victrola, comfortable chairs and a rug.
Over it all the morning sun was streaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s eyes were wide open in
amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; Rhoda answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Nan persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you why,&rdquo; Bess smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because
our cabin was inundated by the recent flood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; Nan
asserted. &ldquo;But I love this place just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we walk right in?&rdquo; It was Laura at the
door. &ldquo;Or do we have to send cards first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed. &ldquo;Come here.
Have you seen this?&rdquo; She moved the dial of a
small radio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I seen that? Why, darling, I moved
your things in,&rdquo; Laura laughed. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s
more, I was here when the Captain came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Captain!&rdquo; They all exclaimed at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he came down in all his glory. He has a
stern looking face complete with a Vandyke beard,
and he wore a uniform with epaulettes and much
fancy braid. He carried a cap in his hand. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
came &lsquo;to see if Miss Sherwood&rsquo;s stateroom was
satisfactory.&rsquo;&rdquo; Laura tried to clip the sentence
off as the Captain had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should hear his accent!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Oxford or Cambridge or something equally
as exclusive, I&rsquo;m sure. I&rsquo;m quite in love with the
man! He&rsquo;s perfectly darling!&rdquo; she finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo; The girls jumped and
looked up, startled, for it was a man&rsquo;s voice. They
recognized at once the uniform, the cap, and the
Vandyke beard. It was the Captain! He must
have heard them!</p>

<p>He looked sternly down on their confusion.
&ldquo;Miss Sherwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain.&rdquo; Nan answered meekly and
started to get up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he motioned her to remain seated.</p>

<p>Nan sat down again. The voice was one that
was accustomed to being obeyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I merely wanted to make certain that everything
was satisfactory.&rdquo; He looked critically about
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is! It is!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
perfect!&rdquo; Not even her confusion could keep the
note of sincerity out of her voice.</p>

<p>The Captain seemed preoccupied with his inspection
of the stateroom. &ldquo;Your baggage has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
been moved.&rdquo; It was more a statement than a
question. &ldquo;You are feeling&mdash;well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, sir,&rdquo; Nan hastened to reply.
Had she felt otherwise she wouldn&rsquo;t have dared
to admit it in the face of his assurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want for nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, sir. Nothing at all.&rdquo; Nan was annoyed
at her own inability to be at ease. If only
he had come at another time!</p>

<p>Then his glance seemed to take in Laura for
the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Polk, I trust that you are comfortable
too.&rdquo; Again, it was a statement and Laura
gulped, not knowing whether she was supposed
to answer or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, ladies.&rdquo; With this he turned and
went out.</p>

<p>Even before his measured tread was entirely
out of earshot, Laura was lamenting. &ldquo;If only I
had kept my mouth shut!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;&lsquo;Oxford
or Cambridge accent.&rsquo;&rdquo; She sounded completely
disgusted. &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in love with the man!
He&rsquo;s perfectly darling.&rsquo; And then he walks in on
me! What can I do? You can&rsquo;t walk up to a man
and apologize for anything like that.&rdquo; She looked
hopelessly at her friends.</p>

<p>Nan was laughing so hard she was holding both
her sides and so was Bess. Rhoda was stuffing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
handkerchief into her mouth. &ldquo;Oh, I never saw
anything so funny in my life,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny!&rdquo; Laura was indignant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
know what was funny about that! Funny!&rdquo; she
muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura,&rdquo; Nan was wiping the tears out of
her eyes. &ldquo;If you could have seen the expression
on your face when he asked whether you were
comfortable, you would laugh too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura grinned with them at this. &ldquo;The old
meany,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He heard every word of what
I said, and he was just rubbing it in. And I
thought he was a chivalrous old duck! I wish he
would come back now. I&rsquo;d tell him what was
what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; Rhoda raised a protesting
hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll meet him soon enough as
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Laura denied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going
to stir out of my cabin from now until the
time the boat docks. I just couldn&rsquo;t face that man
again.&rdquo; She turned as though to leave, but stopped
as Grace came into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; Grace asked. &ldquo;Did you see him
too?&rdquo; Her face was pale and scared looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Rhoda rushed
over and closed the door behind Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man, that red-headed hunchback. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the one that went through Nan&rsquo;s bags. Surely,
you haven&rsquo;t forgotten him. Did you see him,
too?&rdquo; She directed the question at Laura again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Gracie, no, I haven&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo; Laura
was very serious now. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; Grace was pale and frightened.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out there. I think he followed me down
the hall.&rdquo; She was almost hysterical.</p>

<p>Laura moved toward the door and reached
out as if to open it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Grace&rsquo;s voice was a command.
&ldquo;He followed me. I tell you he followed
me!&rdquo; She almost shrieked the last.</p>

<p>Nan got up, went over to the girl, and put
a reassuring arm around her. &ldquo;Grace, please,&rdquo;
she begged. &ldquo;Get hold of yourself. You&rsquo;ll be making
us all panicky. There, now, calm down.&rdquo; She
wiped the girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re treating me like a baby!&rdquo; Grace
shook herself out of Nan&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
She paused and, for a second, the room was in
complete silence.</p>

<p>Through it came the sound of a knock at the
door. The girls looked questioningly at one another,
but no one moved. Then, they heard it
again, faintly.</p>

<p>Laura stirred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to open it,&rdquo; she whispered.
Nan nodded her head. But before Laura<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
could, they heard Amelia&rsquo;s voice. Everyone
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Nan herself walked to the door and threw it
wide open. &ldquo;Come in, Amelia,&rdquo; she said, and then
closed the door after her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Amelia sensed the tenseness in
the room right away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anyone at all in the corridor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan answered the question with another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo; Amelia looked puzzled. &ldquo;No one,
that is, except the stewardess. She&rsquo;s sitting out
there on a stool, knitting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see the red-headed hunchback?&rdquo;
Grace couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see him
standing right out there watching this room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Amelia,&rdquo; Nan asked the question,
&ldquo;that you didn&rsquo;t see anyone besides the
stewardess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I know, because as
I came down the corridor I looked for people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Nan questioned her again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what is this?&rdquo; Amelia asked. &ldquo;The third
degree or something? I looked simply because I&rsquo;ve
been wondering what kind of people lived down in
this end of heaven. Evidently they are all queer.&rdquo;
She looked significantly at the people around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d be queer, too,&rdquo; Grace asserted,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d seen and heard what I did. I was coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
down the corridor alone thinking of Nan and
the new cabin when I heard someone say in a mean
rasping voice, &lsquo;Well, you find out the answer
pretty soon, or you&rsquo;ll never live to see Scotland
again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was scared and would have run, but the cabin
door opened. As it did, I ducked into another and
waited. Oh, it seemed as though I was there for
hours in some strange person&rsquo;s cabin, afraid to
stay and afraid to go. Finally, I couldn&rsquo;t stand it
any longer, so I opened the door quietly and
looked out. There was no one in sight. I tiptoed
down the corridor, and was just about to come
in here, when I saw that awful looking hunchback
standing out there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he was watching this cabin. I would
have turned and run or gone right past him, but
I saw his eyes.&rdquo; Grace shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re terrible eyes. I couldn&rsquo;t go on. I had
to come in here.&rdquo; Grace looked up at Nan as
though asking for approval for what she had
done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you did, Grace,&rdquo; Nan said quietly
and soothingly. &ldquo;Of course, you had to come in.
But tell me,&rdquo; she questioned further. &ldquo;Why did
you say he followed you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I say that?&rdquo; Grace looked puzzled.</p>

<p>They all nodded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Grace shook herself as
though she had difficulty in remembering clearly.
&ldquo;I guess I was just afraid he was, and I knew
that his eyes were on me. Why should he watch
this cabin?&rdquo; She looked up at Nan. The others
followed her glance. They too felt, somehow, that
Nan knew the answer.</p>

<p>Nan sat silently considering.</p>

<p>Should she tell them what she knew or shouldn&rsquo;t
she? Could she trust them? She looked around at
their faces, at Rhoda&rsquo;s and Amelia&rsquo;s, and was
tempted to tell. Both of these girls seemed to
be calm in all the excitement. &ldquo;They might be
able to offer some help if needed,&rdquo; Nan thought.
Then she heard Grace stifle a sob and saw again
how frightened and worried the girl looked. She
hesitated. She looked up at Bess, her closest
friend, and was tempted again.</p>

<p>There was a noise outside. Bess jumped nervously.
She was scared, too. Then Laura spoke,
and Nan gave up all thought of revealing, at the
present at least, what little she knew about the
things that were happening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>NAN PUZZLES OVER HER SECRET</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I wonder if your hunchback is the mysterious
passenger everyone is talking about,&rdquo; Laura said
thoughtfully, when she was convinced that Nan
was not going to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that!&rdquo; This from Rhoda.
&ldquo;But it all fits together perfectly. They say he
never appears at the table for his meals and that
he has his own servants to take care of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bess contributed, &ldquo;a steward told the
stewardess and the stewardess told me that no
one of the ship&rsquo;s crew has been in that cabin since
the boat left dock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been the same stewardess,&rdquo;
Laura picked up the story, &ldquo;who told me that
nothing has gone right in this end of the ship since
he came in. She says there has been trouble, trouble
all the while. She&rsquo;s a superstitious old soul.
She thinks he has cast a spell over everything
around here.&rdquo; Laura&rsquo;s voice was a half whisper as
she imparted her information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d think so too, if you had seen him,&rdquo;
Grace whispered too. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
world they ever let him get a passport and get
on the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I heard somebody say today,&rdquo; Amelia
supplied, as Grace&rsquo;s statement recalled the conversation
to her mind, &ldquo;that he came up the gang-plank
in New York behind the queerest looking
outfit he&rsquo;d ever seen in all the times he has crossed
the ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said the man was all swathed up to the
eyes in an overcoat and a heavy scarf of Scotch
plaid. His collar was turned up and his cap pulled
down so that none of his face was visible. He said
nothing to anyone, refused to let a porter take
a small black valise he was carrying, and went
directly to his cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man who was telling the story said his
stateroom is close by, but that he has never once
met him in the halls. However, he did say, that
from time to time he has heard someone in that
cabin speak in a strong Scotch burr, ordering a
servant around in no uncertain terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the man that you heard,&rdquo; she looked at
Grace, &ldquo;speak like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amelia, I didn&rsquo;t notice what kind of an accent
he used!&rdquo; Grace sounded almost impatient. &ldquo;I was
too frightened to notice anything like that. I only
know what I&rsquo;ve told you already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the man who came looking for me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
first day we came on the boat speak like that?&rdquo;
Nan hardly dared to ask the question. She wanted
information, but she didn&rsquo;t want to give any.</p>

<p>For a moment the girls sat thinking. Then
Laura spoke up. &ldquo;You would think that we would
have noticed that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t honestly
say I did. It was all such a surprise and we were
so excited anyway that I only noticed what he
looked like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t say very much,&rdquo; Rhoda added.
&ldquo;Remember. He spent most of his time looking
around the room and at us as though he wanted
to be sure to remember us always. Ooh, I don&rsquo;t
like to think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I either,&rdquo; Bess was most emphatic. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t seen him at all, and still I don&rsquo;t like to
think about it. It&rsquo;s perfectly horrid to have him
bothering us at all, and if he ever follows me,
I&rsquo;m going to scream so loud that everybody on
this boat will come running. He has no business
at all annoying us this way. We haven&rsquo;t done anything
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan didn&rsquo;t want his old baggage. It wasn&rsquo;t
her fault that it was brought to our cabin. Why,
I&rsquo;ll bet he did it himself or ordered that servant
of his to do it. What for, I don&rsquo;t know, but if
he&rsquo;s queer, there is no accounting for what he
does. I wish they would lock him up or dump him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
overboard or something. We just get rid of Linda
and then he comes here to annoy us. Why can&rsquo;t
people leave us alone?&rdquo; Bess was thoroughly incensed.
&ldquo;We only have a couple of more days on
boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come let&rsquo;s forget it all,&rdquo; Nan interrupted.
She was more than anxious to put the problem
aside for the time being. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk of something
else. Or even better than that, let&rsquo;s go upstairs
and see the pictures the ship&rsquo;s photographer has
been taking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What photographer? What pictures?&rdquo;
Amelia looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to say you haven&rsquo;t seen the photographer
at all!&rdquo; Bess was incredulous. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s
always around with that camera of his. It&rsquo;s almost
impossible to sit or stand any place on deck without
his taking your picture!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Procrastination Boggs,&rdquo; Laura teased,
&ldquo;has been so busy trying to figure out the time
so as to keep her clocks straight that she hasn&rsquo;t
known what was going on around her. Have you
decided yet,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;whether you set the
clock ahead or back when you are traveling east?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went into Amelia&rsquo;s cabin last night,&rdquo; she explained
to the others, &ldquo;and there she was sitting
on the floor with her clocks all around her. She
looked just as she did the night we first saw her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
her room at Lakeview. This time, however, she
had a pencil and paper in her hand. At first, I
thought she had lost her mind, for there were
little marks like chicken scratches on the paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it didn&rsquo;t look like that at all,&rdquo; Amelia
protested. &ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t recognize a good
sketch when you see one. That round mark was
the sun. The long straight one was the path it
takes as it moves from the east to the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the sun doesn&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; Rhoda interrupted.
&ldquo;The earth does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; Laura continued her teasing,
&ldquo;there she was on the floor with her clocks. Each
one was set at a different time and Amelia was
drawing pictures. I heard her muttering to herself,
&lsquo;Now, if the sun rises in the east and sets in
the west and the ship travels east, then we lose
no, we gain time. No, we lose time.&rsquo; She couldn&rsquo;t
make up her mind, so she began all over again,
&lsquo;if the sun rises in the west, I mean the east, and
we travel west, no east&rsquo;&mdash;Say, which way are we
traveling?&rdquo; Laura had confused herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;East.&rdquo; Nan laughed. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t go any further
or you&rsquo;ll have us all confused. Upstairs, near
the Purser&rsquo;s window, there&rsquo;s a blackboard. On it,
it says, &lsquo;Ship&rsquo;s passengers please note: set your
watches ahead 40 minutes each night at 9, if you
wish them to agree with ship&rsquo;s time.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that now,&rdquo; Amelia laughed, ruefully.
&ldquo;I saw it the morning after I&rsquo;d had such a time.
And you needn&rsquo;t act so superior,&rdquo; she looked at
Laura, &ldquo;because you sat down on the floor with
me and tried to figure it out too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The picture that this brought to mind caused all
the girls to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up and see those photographs, right
now,&rdquo; Laura changed the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Amelia agreed. So, walking and
talking the six friends left the cabin and went to
an upper deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess Harley,&rdquo; Nan exclaimed as they stood
around the pictures. &ldquo;How did you ever manage
to get yours taken so many times?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess blushed. She had contrived to have her
picture taken more than anyone else. Now, as
she thought of the number of times she had purposely
posed, hoping that the photographer would
see her, she felt guilty. There were pictures of her
in the deck chair, posed against a life preserver,
and standing at the rail. There was one of her in
a bathing suit on the morning she had gone swimming,
another of her in slacks when she was
headed for the ship&rsquo;s gymnasium, and another in
leather jacket and skirt when the wind was blowing
so hard that her hair was standing on end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, they are all cute,&rdquo; Nan comforted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m as jealous as anything, because there
aren&rsquo;t any of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there is, Nan. Look!&rdquo; Rhoda pointed
her finger to a picture of Nan posted right in
the center of the board. The photographer had
caught her when she was totally unaware of the
rest of the world. He had made a silhouette of
her on the ship&rsquo;s rail, in the place she called her
balcony, looking out over the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how nice!&rdquo; Nan herself was pleased. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to send one home to Momsy.&rdquo; Then a sad
look flashed across her face. She was lonesome
sometimes amid all the new strange things for
her mother, her father, and the little cottage on
Amity street. There were times when she wished
most earnestly that she could consult with her
father or have the bright hopefulness of her
mother&rsquo;s comfort to encourage her.</p>

<p>Her thoughts flashed back to her father&rsquo;s warning
and then to the letter she had received at
Lakeview Hall, the letter she had concealed from
Bess. Was this hunchback who seemed to be
watching her connected in any way with either of
the two? Was he the one her father was warning
her against? Had he had anything to do with
the letter? Nan resolved to get it from the purser
with whom she had left her valuables, look at it
again, and see whether it contained any undiscovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
clues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Nan,&rdquo; Bess brought her
thoughts back to the present. &ldquo;Your mind seems
miles away. We&rsquo;ve all ordered our pictures, and
you haven&rsquo;t had a word to say for the last ten
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan started guiltily, laughed with them at her
own absent-mindedness, bought photographs of
herself and her friends for her memory book,
and then, with them, went into the ship&rsquo;s store to
buy souvenirs for friends back home.</p>

<p>So, in spite of Grace&rsquo;s frightening experience,
the morning was a gay one for the Lakeview Hall
crowd and the afternoon brought a surprise that
even Bess, in her wildest dreams of the nice things
that might happen to them on the boat, had never
imagined.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE CAPTAIN&rsquo;S DINNER</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, I wonder if all the girls received
them! I hope they did!&rdquo; Bess was waving a small
white envelope in her hand. &ldquo;Look, it has the
boat&rsquo;s flag engraved on it and the United States
flag too. Isn&rsquo;t it just too perfect for words!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; Bess hugged her friend, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, as
sure as I am of anything, that it&rsquo;s because of your
saving Linda the way you did, that we got them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s face was alight too. &ldquo;Oh, Bess, it isn&rsquo;t
either,&rdquo; she contradicted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because Dr.
Beulah is the person she is. The Captain was going
to invite her and he thought he had to invite
us too, or we would get into trouble. He doesn&rsquo;t
trust us since the night of the storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You old silly,&rdquo; Bess was not to be gainsaid.
&ldquo;You are just being modest. But go on. I don&rsquo;t
care what the Captain thinks anyway as long as
he continues to do things in the grand manner.
This cabin,&rdquo; she looked around it proudly&mdash;already
she had sent many letters home telling
friends and relatives about every little detail of
its luxuriousness, &ldquo;and now these invitations.
Why, we are practically the belles of the boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
even if Dr. Beulah,&rdquo; she said dolefully, &ldquo;does
try to make us remember that we are still
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, she doesn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo; Nan sprang to
the defense of their preceptor. &ldquo;You know she
doesn&rsquo;t. You know she had been just as nice as she
could possibly be on this trip. She couldn&rsquo;t let you
wear that dress you wanted to the other night. It
wouldn&rsquo;t have looked right. It was, just as she
said, too formal for a young person to wear. It
makes you look old. She was really very pleasant
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she was,&rdquo; Bess calmed Nan&rsquo;s ruffled
feelings. &ldquo;I was only fooling. She was just as
sweet as she could be. Now, come, let&rsquo;s go up and
see if the others have received cards, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have, we have!&rdquo; Grace exclaimed excitedly
when Nan and Bess finally located the
others. &ldquo;We all have invitations to the Captain&rsquo;s
table for dinner tonight! Dr. Beulah says we are
to go, that we may wear our very best dresses,
and that we may stay up tonight for the costume
ball. It&rsquo;s to be the very nicest night on board ship,
for tomorrow morning, early, we sight land and
some of the passengers will be leaving.&rdquo; Grace
was breathless as she finished the end of the
sentence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Laura?&rdquo; Nan looked in vain for
the red-headed girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, where is she?&rdquo; Bess echoed, and then
added, &ldquo;Surely, she received one too. The Captain
didn&rsquo;t leave her out, did he?&rdquo; Bess looked
worried, for she remembered suddenly Laura&rsquo;s
unfortunate encounter with the commander of the
boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She received one all right,&rdquo; Rhoda responded,
&ldquo;and she&rsquo;s down in her cabin practically crying
her eyes out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Nan and Bess chorused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says she can&rsquo;t possibly go to that dinner
and face him. She knows he will laugh at her. She
says she has never been in such an embarrassing
position before. She almost wishes she hadn&rsquo;t
come on this trip at all. You go, Nan, and see
what you can do with her. The more I say, the
harder she cries. I have never seen her in such a
state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. You people stay here and I&rsquo;ll see if
I can persuade her to come up.&rdquo; Nan started off,
but then changed her mind and came back for the
rest of the girls. &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s all go down,&rdquo; she
suggested. &ldquo;I think, after all, that that would
be better.&rdquo; So they went.</p>

<p>They found Laura lying across her bunk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
her face buried in the pillow. Her shoulders were
heaving and she was sobbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura, don&rsquo;t take it so seriously,&rdquo; Nan
stooped over the sobbing girl and gently pulled
her around so that she faced her friends. Her
eyes were red and swollen with crying, and her
red hair was tousled. She put a wadded, tear-wet
handkerchief up to her eyes and wiped them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;I guess you would take it seriously
too,&rdquo; she wept, &ldquo;if you couldn&rsquo;t go to the Captain&rsquo;s
dinner, if you had to send regrets, saying
you were ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura, you haven&rsquo;t done that, have you?&rdquo; The
girls all gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;N&mdash;Not yet!&rdquo; Laura sobbed some more.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not because I didn&rsquo;t try to write it. I&rsquo;ve
got to ask Dr. Beulah how to address it,&rdquo; she
sniffled. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll go up and ask her now.&rdquo;
She sat up on the bunk. &ldquo;Then it will be all over
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; Nan took her friend firmly by the
shoulders. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that you can&rsquo;t refuse.
An invitation from the Captain is practically the
same as a command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I can&rsquo;t go if I have scarlet
fever.&rdquo; Laura was still crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if you have scarlet fever, we can&rsquo;t go
either,&rdquo; Bess was troubled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
you tell him, but you can&rsquo;t tell him that.&rdquo; A look
from Nan silenced Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Laura,&rdquo; Nan shook her friend.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to come to your senses. You simply
have to go. You might just as well make up your
mind to do it now, because you are going if we
have to dress you and drag you there.&rdquo; Nan tried
to look very serious, but somehow she couldn&rsquo;t
suppress a twinkle that came to her eyes. Already
the other girls were smiling. They knew that
Laura would have to give in. The situation
seemed amusing now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t go either,&rdquo; Laura continued, &ldquo;if
you had said the things I did and he had heard
you. The next time I&rsquo;m going to keep my mouth
shut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will,&rdquo; Nan sounded full of conviction.
&ldquo;And this time you&rsquo;ll go, and he will shake
your hand, and you&rsquo;ll smile up at him, and then
everything will be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; Laura was already
more than half willing to be convinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt in the world but what it
will,&rdquo; Nan sounded very positive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Laura gave in at last, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
all promise on your word of honor to stick by
me and come to my rescue if anything embarrassing
happens.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We will, Laura, we will.&rdquo; Grace was almost
jumping up and down with joy. She grabbed Nan&rsquo;s
hand. Nan took Laura&rsquo;s. Laura took Bess&rsquo;s.
Amelia and Rhoda were drawn into the circle and
they all danced around the cabin until they fell
breathless to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, such fun!&rdquo; Bess wiped the tears of excitement
out of her eyes, as they all proceeded to
the business of deciding what to wear to the Captain&rsquo;s
dinner and how to dress for the costume
ball.</p>

<p>That night was unforgettable.</p>

<p>Laura and the Captain were friends just as
Nan had said they would be. Bess was a triumph
in a pretty silk dress. Amelia and Rhoda were
almost speechless when they were seated between
two tall handsome army officers enroute to London
to take part in the coronation, but they forgot
themselves and had the time of their lives as the
dinner progressed. Grace, in her place next to a
foreign diplomat was equally well taken care of.</p>

<p>And Nan, well, as the reader has already
guessed, the dinner invitation was in her honor.
She was seated in the place of honor next to the
Captain and never was a young girl more praised
and honored in an evening than she.</p>

<p>It was all very grand and lovely. Bess had her
moment of supreme rejoicing when she saw out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the corner of her eye that Linda had recovered
and had been allowed to come down for dinner.
There she was, across the dining room from the
Captain&rsquo;s table, watching with envious eyes her
former schoolmates at Lakeview Hall. Bess might
be forgiven, if, when paper caps and toy horns
were passed out, she blew her horn extra loud&mdash;a
blast of triumph in Linda&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>LAND IS SIGHTED</small></h2>


<p>The next morning all the cabins on the boat
looked as though a cyclone had struck them. The
cabins belonging to the girls from Lakeview Hall
were no exception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, if we go on collecting things at this
rate,&rdquo; Nan protested to her friend, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to
buy new luggage. Nothing short of a huge trunk
will hold everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Bess laughed. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s so hard
to throw anything away.&rdquo; She was holding favors
from the costume ball of the night before in her
hand. &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t part with these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls were packing. It was very early
in the morning, but the boat was due to make its
first stop shortly, and they wanted to be on deck
when land was sighted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t part with these
either,&rdquo; Nan held up the limp bags of a half
dozen balloons. &ldquo;A handsome army officer got
them for me last night, by climbing up on a chair
and pulling them by their strings down from the
ceiling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the ballroom lovely, though?&rdquo; Bess
paused in her packing, while she remembered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lights and the palms and the balloons and the
other decorations. Then she recalled all the people
in fancy costume marching around, dancing and
singing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nicest thing of all,&rdquo; Nan paused in her
packing too, &ldquo;was that glass promenade through
which you could see the stars and the sky overhead.
The moon was so big and full that no other
lights were needed. I shall never forget it&mdash;nor
that quartet of sailors that sang all those funny
old sea ballads and then danced the hornpipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls laughed together at the recollection,
and then busied themselves in earnest. Nan kept
the balloons for a couple of children back in Tillbury
whose idol she was. Bess kept the favors,
because she couldn&rsquo;t bear to throw them away.</p>

<p>Again and again, the ship&rsquo;s foghorn blasted the
early morning quietness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we must be
almost in sight of land.&rdquo; Bess hurried faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the steward promised,&rdquo; Nan protested,
&ldquo;that he would tell us so that we would be up on
deck when land was sighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose he has forgotten?&rdquo; Bess
questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Nan was a little worried
too. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s hurry and get out of here. I
wouldn&rsquo;t miss seeing Maureen off for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is she getting off here?&rdquo; Bess took one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
last look around the cabin to see whether she had
all her belongings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s headed right for Dublin.&rdquo; Nan
tried to give an Irish turn to her sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see her again?&rdquo; Bess was wide-eyed
as it suddenly dawned on her that they were
saying good-by, perhaps forever, to their shipboard
acquaintances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never say that,&rdquo; Nan unconsciously interpreted
the lesson Hetty&rsquo;s grandmother had taught
so sweetly several days before. &ldquo;You never know
when or where you will meet these people again.
Have you kept many addresses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just dozens,&rdquo; Bess answered. &ldquo;If I ever
hear from a third of them again, I&rsquo;ll be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel the same way,&rdquo; Nan agreed. &ldquo;Only
Maureen, Hetty and Jeanie have all agreed to
have tea with us in London. I knew you would all
approve.&rdquo; She looked up at Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Approve? Of course,&rdquo; Bess agreed. &ldquo;Tea in
London with Maureen, Hetty, and Jeanie. Oh, I
hope they won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nan said confidently, as she got
up from her place on the floor by her bags.
&ldquo;There, I&rsquo;m all packed and ready for the steward
to come and put the tags on them. Are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a second&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m all ready, too, now.&rdquo;
Bess closed hers. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up on deck.&rdquo; So they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
went up and out, and saw, for the first time while
on the boat, the sunrise. The sky was full of
promise for a bright day.</p>

<p>Even as they watched the light breaking brighter
and brighter, the ship&rsquo;s whistle gave three loud
blasts. There were three more from shore, and
Nan clutched Bess&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;See, there it is&mdash;Ireland,
the coast of Ireland. See the lights?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis me home,&rdquo; Maureen had come
up behind them, &ldquo;the grandest place in all the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What county is that?&rdquo; Nan looked to Maureen
for information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain,&rdquo; Maureen replied, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m after thinking that that&rsquo;s the coast of Donegal,
and a lovelier spot you&rsquo;ll not find for many
miles. Beyond lies Londonderry and after that
you&rsquo;ll be seeing Portrush and then at last Belfast!
It&rsquo;s beauty, beauty all the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your America, it&rsquo;s fine and grand with all its
tall buildings and great cities, but me heart is
warm for Ireland. There me mother and father
and little brothers and sisters will be waiting. Oh,
it&rsquo;s good to be back.&rdquo; Maureen wiped tears from
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Maureen,&rdquo; Nan and Bess were close
to tears too, for her pang of homesickness had
turned their own thoughts back to America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go down into the dining room. Let&rsquo;s
see if we can find one big table so that we can all
have this last breakfast together.&rdquo; As she finished
speaking, Nan tucked Maureen&rsquo;s arm through
hers and started.</p>

<p>It was a merry breakfast and a sad one in the
weird light of the dining room, half daylight,
half electricity. There were people glad to be
home and people sad to be parting from newfound
friends. Breakfast was eaten hastily, so that
everyone was up on deck waving goodbyes, calling
last minute messages, urging care, and trying
to joke, all in one breath, as the great steamer
settled to anchor and a small tender nestled up
to it.</p>

<p>Maureen&rsquo;s dad, a burly looking Irishman with
eyes of the deepest blue and lashes long and
heavy, came aboard and took her in his arms.
&ldquo;Sure and &rsquo;tis good to have me baby home agin,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s mighty fine you&rsquo;re looking in
that perky new bonnet.&rdquo; He pushed her straw hat
up and looked into her eyes. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not changed
a bit you are after all that long journey,&rdquo; he
added.</p>

<p>He turned to her friends, &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll not be
comin&rsquo; to Ireland this trip?&rdquo; He sounded genuinely
disappointed. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo; back.&rdquo;
He smiled kindly down upon them all. &ldquo;And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
you&rsquo;ll be stoppin&rsquo; here and we&rsquo;ll be meetin&rsquo; you
and you&rsquo;ll be off to Dublin Town with the likes
of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan liked Maureen&rsquo;s father. So did her
friends. As he and Maureen went across the gang-plank
to the tender, they all hung over the rail
and waved. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be seeing you in London,&rdquo;
Nan called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; Bess followed suit, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s tea in
London in coronation week.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>BE CAREFUL, NAN!</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Are your passports all stamped for landing?
Is your baggage tagged for Glasgow? Are you
sure you have everything?&rdquo; Dr. Beulah smiled
down at the excited brood of young girls under
her charge. &ldquo;Have each of you a supply of English
pounds and shillings? In short, are you ready
to leave this boat and step your foot on foreign
soil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were all standing together on the boat&rsquo;s
deck watching the maneuverings as the ship came
to rest in its dock just outside Glasgow. There
had been no end to the excitement since the girls
waved Maureen off at Belfast and the ship
steamed across the North Channel to the Firth
of Clyde, passing countless fishing boats along the
way.</p>

<p>Bess had turned from waving Maureen off and
started back to the cabin. Midway, she had a
strange presentiment that something was vitally
wrong. She walked gingerly down the hallway,
looking to the right and left at the narrow corridors
between groups of staterooms. When she
came to that from which Grace had said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Scotch hunchback had come forth several mornings
before, she walked very quietly and listened
attentively. She neither heard nor saw anything.
It was as if the cabin was empty.</p>

<p>That in itself was strange, for the doors of
all the cabins along the way were open. In each,
baggage awaited porters who were even now busy
in front cabins labeling it and carting it to an
upper deck. &ldquo;Maybe the mystery has taken his
baggage and walked out on us,&rdquo; Bess thought as
she continued down the corridor intent on making
one more check of the stateroom to make certain
that nothing was being forgotten.</p>

<p>The thought relieved her, and she was even
humming a little tune when she turned into her
own stateroom. She stopped short. There, kneeling
in front of Nan&rsquo;s baggage, was the red-headed
hunchback!</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her. She would have
screamed, but in a flash he was at her side and
his hand was clamped over her mouth. He looked
at her very intently with strange piercing eyes.</p>

<p>But his voice was almost gentle as he spoke.
&ldquo;&rsquo;T would be weel, ver-r-ry weel,&rdquo; he said in a
strong Scotch burr, &ldquo;if ye didna speak. These
things ha&rsquo; no par-r-t of ye.&rdquo; With this, he turned
and left the room.</p>

<p>Bess sank into a chair, full of conflicting emotions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and was there thinking, when Nan came
into the stateroom after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess, why Bess,&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, &ldquo;what is the
matter with you? You looked scared to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess whimpered softly, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; This sounded
strange coming from Bess, and was strange in the
face of her avowal of a few days before that
if she ever came upon him alone she would scream
so loud that everybody on the boat would come
running. It was strange too, because Bess, generally,
when upset at all, responded with a torrent
of words. Now, she looked wilted as though every
ounce of energy had been squeezed out of her.</p>

<p>Nan got her a glass of water and held it as
she sipped slowly. Then she smiled wanly and sat
silent, for a while, collecting her thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, it&rsquo;s that red-headed hunchback again,&rdquo;
she said, finally. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to tell me what
you know about him. I came upon him just now
in our cabin. He was over there,&rdquo; her voice grew
stronger as she spoke, but sounded sharp and
nervous, &ldquo;by your baggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan went over and carefully examined her
locked baggage. It hadn&rsquo;t been tampered with.
She felt this instinctively just as soon as she put
her hands on it. What had the hunchback intended
to do before Bess discovered him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo; She turned to Bess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Bess considered before answering. Were the
deformed little man&rsquo;s words a warning? Had he
meant that she shouldn&rsquo;t repeat what he had said?
Had he meant that she shouldn&rsquo;t tell of his presence
at all? Bess was startled as this latter
thought came to her, startled and frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;don&rsquo;t remember what he said,&rdquo; Bess
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Harley,&rdquo; Nan looked down at her
sternly, &ldquo;You know very well that you remember
what he said. Come, now, tell me. I have to
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> have to know!&rdquo; Bess was angry now.
&ldquo;Nan, I&rsquo;d like to know, too, what all this is about.
This man has been watching you ever since we
boarded the steamer in New York. You know it,
and I know it, too. Moreover, your father warned
you, just before he left, to be careful. I thought
at the time that it meant nothing more than the
warning my mother gave me, to take care of my
luggage and myself. Now I think differently.
Somehow, his voice sounded more earnest than
that of the rest of our parents. I think he meant
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s something else, some other clue
that I can&rsquo;t quite remember, that makes me certain
things are all wrong. Nan, please explain
what it&rsquo;s all about,&rdquo; Bess pleaded. But before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Nan had a chance to say anything, Bess went on
untangling the confused jumble in her own mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this I can&rsquo;t understand either,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;Grace couldn&rsquo;t remember whether he had
a Scotch accent or not. I think it&rsquo;s something you
couldn&rsquo;t possibly overlook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan made a mental note and kept quiet, hoping,
that Bess would go on revealing what she had
found out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Bess continued, all unaware that she
was doing just what Nan wanted her to do,
&ldquo;Grace was scared to death and kept talking
about his piercing eyes that looked right through
you and made you do what he wanted you to. The
other girls spoke about them too, after he confronted
them in the cabin that first morning. His
eyes are strange, but when he spoke to me, his
voice was as gentle as it could possibly be. Why,
he all but patted me on the shoulder.&rdquo; Bess herself
was surprised that the thought didn&rsquo;t bring any
feeling of revolt.</p>

<p>Nan looked at her. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d almost say you
liked the mysterious old Scotchman,&rdquo; she said in a
surprised tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; Bess responded thoughtfully,
&ldquo;but I did feel almost sorry for him. He looked
meek and gentle, but withal very frightened as he
left this room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When he said, referring to the mysteries hereabouts,
&lsquo;that these things didna ha&rsquo; no part of me,&rsquo;
he really sounded very kindly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo; The question was out before
Nan thought. She had been worried for fear
the plot that involved her would draw her friends
into its net.</p>

<p>With Nan&rsquo;s question, Bess suddenly realized
that she had revealed all she knew without learning
a thing. &ldquo;Why, you double-dyed deceiver,&rdquo;
she said in a surprised tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you everything
I know, and you haven&rsquo;t said a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan looked confused. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, Bess,&rdquo;
she confessed. &ldquo;I had to know what had happened,
and there seemed no other way of finding
out. Now, let&rsquo;s forget it all for the time being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just tell me one thing,&rdquo; Bess begged, when
she saw that Nan was not going to reveal all that
she knew. &ldquo;Do you know who the red-headed
Scotchman is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan considered the question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain,&rdquo;
she said as though to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you think&mdash;&rdquo; Bess spoke quietly, hoping
that Nan would finish her deliberations aloud.
She was trying Nan&rsquo;s own tactics now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it is some distant member of my mother&rsquo;s
family,&rdquo; Nan said slowly. &ldquo;I saw the names
and stateroom numbers, on a bulletin outside, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
those who are disembarking at Glasgow. The man
in cabin 846 is Robert Hugh Blake! &lsquo;Hugh&rsquo; is
an old family name on my mother&rsquo;s side and
&lsquo;Blake&rsquo; is her maiden name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember the passenger list that was
given us at the Captain&rsquo;s dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess nodded her head. Hers was among the
things she was saving for souvenirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is on that, too. And it has his home
listed as &lsquo;Glasgow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything more about him.
You&rsquo;ve never heard your mother or anyone speak
of him?&rdquo; Bess followed up Nan&rsquo;s revelation, hoping
to hear more.</p>

<p>Nan ignored the first question. &ldquo;Momsy never
did speak very much of her people in Scotland,&rdquo;
she said in answer to the second. &ldquo;She was very
fond of her great uncle, Hugh Blake, the one
whose estate she inherited, but I don&rsquo;t think she
ever saw him. She liked him, because her father
did. She loved everything that he loved. Since this
great uncle is the only one he ever talked much
about, he is the only one I know of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she has mentioned others, vaguely, from
time to time, but I don&rsquo;t remember their names.
However, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard the name
of this particular person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know at all why he should be camping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
on your doorstep?&rdquo; Bess questioned further.</p>

<p>But Nan was not revealing any more now. Certain
that her friend had recovered from her shock,
she ignored the question, took one more look at
her baggage, and called a steward. He came
promptly, and before Nan and Bess left their
stateroom again, all the baggage had been taken
upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I guess that fixes that,&rdquo; Nan observed
as they left the stateroom for the last time. &ldquo;The
steward will have charge of the baggage now
until we land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Bess began as
though there was only one question left in her
mind, &ldquo;is why Mr. Robert Hugh Blake is so determined
to get into your baggage. What have
you that&rsquo;s so valuable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, lassie, nothing,&rdquo; Nan answered.
&ldquo;Only a lot of dresses that wouldn&rsquo;t become him,
even if he could get them on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess giggled at this. Nan took her by the arm.
&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she said earnestly and quickly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
say anything to anyone about what has happened
today. I&rsquo;m sure it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess remembered a similar promise, given at a
time of other trouble in Florida, just as those
readers who have read &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Beach&rdquo; will remember. &ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
reassured her friend.</p>

<p>Nan looked her thanks. As the sound of the
skirling of bagpipes reached them, they hastened
their steps and joined Dr. Beulah Prescott and
the rest of their Lakeview Hall friends on deck,
and so were in the group when Dr. Prescott asked
the question, &ldquo;Are you ready to leave this boat
and step your foot on foreign soil?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>WELCOME, LASSIES, TO SCOTLAND</small></h2>


<p>Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s question went unanswered. The
clank of the chain as deckhands dropped the gang-plank
from ship to shore attracted the attention
of the girls even as she asked it. Now they moved
forward slowly, with the rest of the passengers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there! We&rsquo;re almost there!&rdquo;
Bess could hardly contain herself. &ldquo;Now we are
getting nearer and nearer and nearer. One more
step. Two more steps. We made it!&rdquo; she exclaimed
triumphantly as she stepped her foot on
the gangplank and carefully walked its length.
Nan was at her heels. Then one by one the others
disentangled themselves from the crowded deck
and joined those on shore, until they all stood
together, &ldquo;like a group of lost baffled children,&rdquo;
Dr. Prescott said, as she joined them and herded
them through a door and into a long shed-like
station.</p>

<p>There, everything seemed in confusion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like the Grand Central Station in New York and
the dock where we boarded the ship all rolled into
one,&rdquo; Laura whispered into Nan&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, only you don&rsquo;t see kilted highlanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and bagpipes and English officers in either of
those places,&rdquo; Nan returned, waving and smiling
across the top of somebody&rsquo;s bags to Hetty, who
had attracted her attention from the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, lassies, to Scotland.&rdquo; A voice from
behind them caused them to turn and there was
Jeanie. &ldquo;Ha&rsquo; ye learned your way aboot yet?&rdquo; she
grinned at her American friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re no so guid as that.&rdquo; Nan recalled as
best she could her own mother&rsquo;s Scotch dialect,
but let it go again as she called after Jeanie,
&ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s tea in London during coronation
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, and I&rsquo;ll not be forgettin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Jeanie flung
over her shoulder before she was lost in the crowd
of English, Irish and Scotch people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Porter, porter, porter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Taxi, taxi.&rdquo; &ldquo;Car
for Royal Scott Hotel.&rdquo; The calls were all around
them in more variations of the English tongue
than they ever knew existed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, girls, this way,&rdquo; Dr. Prescott beckoned
them to follow her. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the baggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess turned and followed her. Rhoda, Amelia,
Grace, and Laura were already at her side. Nan
started too, but a small child, tears streaming
down its face, halted her.</p>

<p>She stooped down, pulled its grimy fists out of
its eyes, pushed its blond hair back, and comforted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
&ldquo;There, child, there. Don&rsquo;t cry. What has
happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didna ken.&rdquo; The child cried harder than
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didna ken,&rdquo; the answer was the same, but
he grabbed hold of her coat and pulled her along
after him.</p>

<p>She glanced back toward her friends, but could
catch no one&rsquo;s attention. She stopped. The small
force below her tugged hard at her coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye canna stop noo.&rdquo; He was a persistent little
Scotsman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I canna,&rdquo; Nan thought to herself and
followed, wondering what it was all about. He
led her past the baggage, the train, and a small
window where men were busy changing American
dollars to English pounds. They passed lunch
carts, magazine racks, and an information tower.
Once Nan stopped, but the little urchin&rsquo;s eyes
filled so quickly with tears that she gave up completely
and resolved to find out what was wrong.</p>

<p>Finally, they came to a high iron fence through
the gates of which no one could go without a passport
or permit. The small boy shied away from
this public entrance, followed the fence around
to its joining with the wall. There, stuffed between
fence and concrete floor, was a bagpipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
almost as big as the child himself. He stooped
over and tugged at it. It wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</p>

<p>Nan knelt down and tugged, too. Between the
two of them, after much twisting and turning,
pushing and pulling, the bagpipe was pulled
through. The child swung a strap over his shoulder,
looked up at her brightly now, and with a
&ldquo;thank ye, thank ye&rdquo; ran along ahead of her playing
&ldquo;On the Bonnie Bonnie Banks of Loch
Lomond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She saw him once again before she left the
station. It was just before the train pulled out.
He stood beneath her compartment window and
played the same tune again. This time tourists
were throwing pennies and ha&rsquo;pennies at his feet
and he was smiling broadly.</p>

<p>He waved up at Nan and called, &ldquo;Noo ane for
ye.&rdquo; She laughed and nodded, as he swung into
the tune a third time. At the end, Nan tossed him
a coin. He fingered it carefully, his Scotch thrift
fighting with his feeling of gratitude, but finally
the better man won and he threw it back up to her.</p>

<p>The sound of his playing was still in her ears
as the train pulled out for Emberon. Though she
could not have known it then, the single tune that
he knew was to be a kind of theme song playing
itself most unexpectedly through her Emberon
experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The ride from Glasgow, Great Britain&rsquo;s second
largest city, to Emberon, a small village on the
coast of one of Scotland&rsquo;s many fjords took only
a few hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a short ride,&rdquo; Nan wrote later to her
mother, &ldquo;from Glasgow to Emberon, but such
fun! The trains were queer, like those you see
sometimes in the movie with a corridor the whole
length of each car. The passengers all sit in little
compartments that have two seats facing one another.
We all sat together, of course. Laura, Bess,
and Dr. Beulah were on one side and Grace,
Rhoda, Amelia, and myself on the other. When
we ate, as we did soon after we were outside the
city, the steward pulled a little table down between
us so that we were really quite snug and
cozy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nice, eating Scotch broth (and how
good it was!) while a Scotch landscape unwound
itself at your side. I say this now, but, really, we
were so excited that we hardly knew at all what
was happening. Oh, mother, we are seeing so
many strange new things all the time that my
tongue can hardly keep up with my eyes! When
I get home I&rsquo;m going to talk and talk and talk
until you feel as though you had taken the trip
yourself, but then you and Papa know all about it,
because you were here not long ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised how many people I meet
who remember you. The old coachman who met
us at the station, the people in the village, oh,
everyone here, tells me what a nice mother and
father I have, until sometimes I grow very lonesome
to see you. I got your cable at Glasgow. I
am being very careful, truly, and I will write you
all about everything when I get to Edinburgh
where I am hoping there will be some letters from
you. Until then&mdash;<br />

<span  class="rght3">My love,</span><br />
<span  class="rght">Nan.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;Until then&rdquo;&mdash;the words were simple, but how
much was to happen &ldquo;until then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan had been told what Emberon was like and
had told her friends, but even then it came as a
surprise. She had known that it was a gray and
dreary looking place high up on a hill some distance
from the village, but how dreary she never
could have imagined.</p>

<p>It was dusk when they drove up the steep rough
road that was the only entrance to the ancient
estate. The high old-fashioned carriage that they
had climbed up into at the station rocked precariously
from side to side as the horses, almost
as ancient as the carriage itself, pulled it along.</p>

<p>In the half light, the girls looked at one another
and at Dr. Beulah. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost spooky,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Grace huddled closer to Laura as she spoke, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These old estates,&rdquo; Dr. Beulah explained,
&ldquo;were almost all fortresses at one time. They are
built high up on hills so that they have a natural
means of defense against the surrounding country.
The original owners were lords who were
almost kings in their own right. They fought,
now against one another, now against England,
holding princes and princesses, kings and queens
as pawns. No man knew for sure who was his
friend and who his enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stakes were high in those days. Each man
thought that Scotland was his for the fighting.
So, when he got himself some land and built himself
his castle, he went out to conquer the surrounding
country. It was fight, fight, fight all the
time, one Scottish clan against another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was Scotland against England and
the Scottish world was full of spies. That very
song the lad back in the station played over and
over again &lsquo;On the Bonnie Bonnie Banks of Loch
Lomond,&rsquo; is the story of a Scotsman who was
captured by the English. The lake itself is not
very far from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she went on, as she saw that she
had the attention of all the girls, &ldquo;that the hero
of that song belonged to one of the Highland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
clans and was captured by the English at the
battle of Culloden. He was taken to Carlisle
where he was tried for treason and condemned
to be executed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as a special favor,&rdquo; she paused and waited
while the carriage went around a sharp bend in
the road, and then continued, &ldquo;the night before
his execution, he was allowed to receive a visit
from his betrothed. In bidding her goodby&mdash;and
she is supposed to have been a very beautiful
Scotch girl&mdash;his heart turned homeward to the
scenes of other, happy days. He told her that his
spirit would be there before she arrived, that he
would meet her at their former trysting place.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet where we parted in yon shady glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nan was humming the words over to herself
even as the carriage came to a stop before the
gates of the ancient estate. The driver climbed
down from his high seat in front and pulled a
rope. A bell rang in the distance, the gates
opened, and now, almost proudly, the horses
pulled the carriage up a short driveway and
stopped. A proud dignified old gentleman came
out to greet them.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>EMBERON</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Welcome, thrice welcome to Emberon,&rdquo; he
greeted. &ldquo;And you, my dear,&rdquo; he continued as
they walked in through big doors to a high old
hall, &ldquo;you, I&rsquo;m sure, are Nancy Sherwood.&rdquo; His
voice was soft and low as he spoke to her. He
placed his hand on her head. &ldquo;A Blake through
and through,&rdquo; he went on, smiling down at her
surprise at his instant recognition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same clear eyes, determined little chin,
and proud carriage. Your mother has it too, when
she is well. And her father before her, Randolph
Hugh Blake&mdash;he was a wee lad when he first
visited his uncle here&mdash;he had those eyes. You
are all cut from the same pattern as Hugh Blake,
the well-beloved steward of Emberon for nigh on
to sixty years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are glad to see you, little mistress,&rdquo; he
said quaintly, as he rang a bell for a servant.</p>

<p>Nan looked up, startled, at the term &ldquo;mistress.&rdquo;
Was it right to address her so? A wave of
shyness came over her. She looked about at the
ancient hall with its obsolete firearms hanging
on the walls, its big soft rug, tapestries, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
armor of a knight long dead standing in the
corner. So this was Emberon! This was the estate
her mother had inherited! This was the place her
mother and father had visited a year, two years
before, while she had been in Pine Camp and then
at Lakeview Hall. Nan drew a deep breath, trying
hard to realize it all.</p>

<p>For a few moments, they all stood around telling
the venerable old gentleman, James Blake,
who was a distant relative of Mrs. Sherwood&rsquo;s,
of their journey. Then, as the servant he had
summoned appeared, he spoke again to Nan with
the utmost deference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your apartments are ready upstairs,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Go quickly, for it is late and some in the village
have prepared an entertainment for the lassies
from America. It is quite necessary that you go
down, for most of them down there are people
who know the Blake story from beginning to end.
Hugh Blake was an idol in these parts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He treated those who were under him with
such kindness and thoughtfulness that they looked
upon him almost as a father. He took care of
them when they were sick, watched over them
when they were in trouble, comforted them when
their young folks went off to the cities or to America.
He saw that none went hungry. He helped
them whenever he could, and when he died, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
mourned as though he was one of theirs. Now
they are anxious to see his youngest descendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though I know you are tired,&rdquo; he chuckled as
they all shook their heads, &ldquo;you must make the
most of your short stay here. Upstairs, my sister
has everything in readiness. Now, begone with
you.&rdquo; He dismissed them and turned toward the
big fireplace to warm his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nan Sherwood!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed as
soon as they left the reception hall, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a castle!
And you are the princess!&rdquo; Although Bess was
fooling, she was very much impressed at all she
had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my subjects and you had better behave,&rdquo;
Nan laughed as they were ushered into a
group of big bedrooms with high canopied beds,
huge chests, heavy rugs, thick damask drapes,
everything dark and faded, the luxuries of ages
gone by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, princess of Emberon,&rdquo; Laura made a
brief curtsey. &ldquo;We are at your command. Your
ladies in waiting await your orders.&rdquo; She took
Nan&rsquo;s hand and led her to a high-backed oaken
chair where Nan seated herself for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your subjects, madame,&rdquo; Laura waved her
hand toward the others, and then added, &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t amount to much, but they are the best we
have to offer at present.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s treason!&rdquo; Amelia exclaimed, &ldquo;treason!
We&rsquo;re loyal subjects and true. We are daughters
of Scotland and defenders of the Blake clan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were acting. It was their own version
of a scene from a class play they had once acted
in at Lakeview. The room&rsquo;s setting had brought it
all back to mind. But in acting they were prophesying
too, prophesying something even more
romantic than the scene the present brought to
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Defenders of the Blake clan! Ah, how it
needs you! Come, rally round!&rdquo; Nan pretended
to sound the call to battle as she left her regal
seat and plunged into the job of unpacking.</p>

<p>The others followed suit. The stern faces of
the ancient lairds of Emberon that looked down
on them from heavy gilt frames on the wall never
saw six more industrious girls than those in the
Lakeview crowd as they unpacked and dressed.</p>

<p>Once Laura looked up at them. &ldquo;I must say,&rdquo;
she said then to Nan, &ldquo;that this isn&rsquo;t a very cheerful
looking bunch of ancestors that is watching
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan paused in her work to look, too. &ldquo;They
aren&rsquo;t, are they?&rdquo; she agreed, walking around
the room and looking intently at each of their
faces. &ldquo;These are portraits, I think, of the first
of the lairds of Emberon. A fighting lot they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
were and as straight-laced as the best of the
Scotsmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They look it,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;I, personally,
feel as though they disapprove of every single
dress I&rsquo;m taking out of this bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, how should they be made to satisfy
those crusty old gentlemen?&rdquo; She held one up to
herself. &ldquo;It should be tighter in the bodice, have
a ruff around the neck, and the skirt,&rdquo; she looked
down at the trim pleats in her own, &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s
all wrong! It should be long and full, just touching
the floor. No wonder they disapprove. I am
disgusted myself,&rdquo; she added, looking up at one
of the solemn faces and winking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Laura Polk,&rdquo; Rhoda had been watching
and listening to the little by-play, &ldquo;You had better
be more respectful to your hosts,&rdquo; she nodded toward
the portraits, &ldquo;or tonight, at the parade of
the ghosts, you will be taught a well-deserved
lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parade of the ghosts!&rdquo; The exclamation was
Grace&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, I had forgotten completely
about that,&rdquo; Laura looked very serious. &ldquo;At the
stroke of midnight in these ancient castles, all of
the skeletons come out of the closets and the dungeons
and the secret stairways and the cellars
and the attics, walk through the halls, rattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
around a bit, clank a few chains and then do some
fancy haunting. If they are healthy ghosts, they
groan. If they are weaklings, they just whistle
round a bit. Oh, there is no end to the excitement
in these hoary places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides the ghosts and skeletons, there are
always a few dissatisfied retainers who welcome
the first opportunity to polish off the living owners.
They hang around,&rdquo; Laura was entirely oblivious
to the fact that she had, for once in her
life, startled Nan, &ldquo;in caves, abandoned buildings,
and sometimes behind sliding doors, and appear
on the slightest pretext.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But never fear, my lassies,&rdquo; her voice came
from the depths of her case, as she searched
around the bottom for a small gold bracelet, &ldquo;the
line of the lairds of Emberon has died out, the
Princess tells me, and so there&rsquo;s no one here to be
polished off. We have nothing to worry about,&rdquo;
she ended as she found the bracelet and clasped
it around her wrist, &ldquo;except ghosts and
skeletons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And old Mr. Blake who is waiting downstairs
for us, I am sure,&rdquo; Nan added as she moved toward
the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t harm a hair of anyone&rsquo;s head,&rdquo;
Rhoda joined Nan. &ldquo;Are all the Blakes so nice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan didn&rsquo;t answer. Both Laura and Rhoda had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
brought to mind one of the Blakes whom she was
trying hard to forget&mdash;Robert Hugh Blake, the
hunchback. She remembered suddenly that she
had forgotten completely to reread the letter that
had come to mind again those last days on the
boat. Now, there was no time as together they
went out, joined Dr. Prescott, and descended to
the Great Hall where old James Blake was awaiting
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all quite comfortable?&rdquo; He smiled at
the excited faces. It was good to have voices and
laughter ringing through the rooms again. It reminded
him of the old days when people were
always about. In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw men returning
from the hunt, couples dancing, great
tables groaning with food, excited groups discussing
politics, Christmas parties for the young folk,
feasts for everyone, servants and all, on the master&rsquo;s
birthday.</p>

<p>Then, in a flash, for he was a religious soul,
the vision changed, and it was Sunday morning.
The Laird himself was at the head of the room,
there near one of the two great fireplaces. The
Bible was open before him, and he was reading
to the household of Emberon, kneeling in the
Great Hall before him.</p>

<p>Those had been the good days. James Blake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
wiped an involuntary tear out of his eye. He was
an old man and tears came easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he said gruffly as he nodded to
the girls, &ldquo;the carriage is waiting and already we
are late.&rdquo; He led the way out of the room to a
side entrance. Soon the dull sound of the horses&rsquo;
hoofs beating against the road was echoing back
through the night to the castle, as the carriage
wound its way down the road to the lighted
village.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>SCOTTISH GAMES AND SCOTTISH TUNES</small></h2>


<p>It was a gala scene that met their eyes as they
drove into the village.</p>

<p>There, around a game field lighted by myriads
of small electric bulbs, the whole population of
the town was collected. Everyone was in holiday
mood. All eyes were riveted on a brass band of
kilted Highlanders marching up and down the
field when Nan and her friends made their appearance.
At a signal, the band struck up a happy
welcoming tune as the girls were ushered directly
to a group of seats opposite the very center of
the field. Everyone stood up and clapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems almost like the good old high school
days at Tillbury,&rdquo; Bess whispered to Nan, &ldquo;I half
expect a cheerleader to appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; The warning was Nan&rsquo;s, for after the
girls acknowledged the greeting by bowing and
smiling and had seated themselves, the contests
began.</p>

<p>First, there was the bagpipe competition. At opposite
ends of the field on wooden platforms,
raised so that everyone could see, the Angus MacPhersons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Donald MacDonalds, and James Mackenzies
of the village marched very slowly around
and around playing jigs and reels and all sorts
of Scottish Highland tunes.</p>

<p>How weird the music seemed to the ears of the
American girl! It wasn&rsquo;t gay enough for Bess
who liked only the jazz music that she could hear
at home. She grew restless. But Nan and Laura,
always interested in strange new things, sat on the
very edge of their seats, anxious not to miss any
detail of what was happening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I&rsquo;d like to awaken Mrs. Cupp some
drizzly dark morning with bagpipe music!&rdquo;
Laura&rsquo;s eyes danced merrily at the thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be expelled as sure as anything,&rdquo; Nan
whispered back. &ldquo;Will you look at that?&rdquo; She almost
fell off the edge of the seat in her excitement.</p>

<p>The Highlanders had retired for a while and,
racing across the field now, were teams of two
men each, one pushing a wheelbarrow and the
other in it. When they missed the goal, as they
generally did, a bucket, suspended from a beam
above the goal line, tipped and drenched the two
with water, to the great amusement of the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what fun!&rdquo; Laura exclaimed. &ldquo;Look!
There goes another bucket over. He got it right
in the face!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look at the next one,&rdquo; Bess was interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
too, now. &ldquo;Is he going to get by safely? No,
look, Nan!&rdquo; She grabbed her friend&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;The
wheelbarrow and everything is going to go over
now! Are they hurt?&rdquo; She closed her eyes and
looked the other way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess, they&rsquo;re not hurt, they&rsquo;re just half
drowned,&rdquo; Nan was laughing heartily. This was
fun to watch, better than any circus. The crowd
cheered and laughed and clapped and laughed
again. &ldquo;Tilting the Bucket&rdquo; was one of the favorite
Scottish games.</p>

<p>Next came the highpoint of the evening&mdash;the
dancing of the Highland Fling and the Sword
Dance. Such dancing! The tall, straight, skirted
Highlanders with their white jackets and green
kilts went from movement to movement, swinging
rhythmically and gracefully, leaving the girls
breathless at the end. The crowd applauded, long
and loudly.</p>

<p>The dancers came back and did the Highland
Fling over again. The crowd wouldn&rsquo;t let them
leave. They cheered and whistled. The dancers
repeated again and again, each time doing it
better than the last.</p>

<p>The group of three that finally won the evening&rsquo;s
prize, a five pound note, climaxed their conquest
of the crowd by donating the money to the
village coronation fund! The winner of the bagpipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
contest followed suit and then the Broad
Jump champion, the winner of the Mile Run and
the Hurdle Races joined in. Before the crowd
really realized what it was doing, everyone was
throwing coins toward the center of the field. The
band started to play &ldquo;God Save the King!&rdquo; Everyone
stood up. They sang, first the English National
Anthem and then Scotch song after Scotch
song.</p>

<p>Finally the lights blinked. The band played
&ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo; again and everyone moved
slowly away. It had been a grand evening with
some fifty pounds added to the village fund for
a stupendous celebration on the day of the crowning
of the King and Queen.</p>

<p>Nan and her friends shook hands with the committee
that had planned the evening&rsquo;s entertainment.
Villager after villager stopped to talk with
this young descendant of Hugh Blake who had
come from far away America to see the old estate.
They were simple folk, straightforward and honest
in their appraisal of the brown-eyed American,
but they found nothing to criticize. Somehow,
Nan was able to make them feel that she was one
of them, and as they went away gossiping about
Old Hugh and young Nan, they all agreed that
she was a &ldquo;bonnie, bonnie lassie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The committee, escorting the visitors back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the carriage, urged them to stay in Emberon for
the coronation celebration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, and it will be a gr-r-r-and day here,&rdquo;
William MacDonald, the chairman, urged. &ldquo;In
London, noo, I&rsquo;ll gr-r-r-ant ye, it will be ver-r-ry
guid too, but mind ye, ye cudna find no better
celebration than the one here at Emberon. It&rsquo;s
ver-r-ry proud we are of his Royal Highness and
her Ladyship. They pass here ver-r-ry often on
their way to the North. Aye, and even once they
stopped to watch the games. That was the time
young MacDonald, my nephew, ye ken,&rdquo; he explained
proudly, &ldquo;tossed the caber so high and
over so cleanly, that the guid king himself, mind
ye, shook him by the hand. Aye, and that was a
gr-r-r-and day.&rdquo; The old man stopped while he
thought it all over again, remembering how he
had stood right next to his nephew when the king
congratulated him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye stay?&rdquo; He repeated his invitation, as
with an effort, he shook the memory of that bygone
day from his mind and came back to the
present and the young Blake lass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noo, and she cudna,&rdquo; old James Blake stepped
into the conversation. &ldquo;Ither, bigger things,&rdquo; he
lapsed into the dialect of the villagers about him,
&ldquo;are hers in London town.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Old MacDonald looked up. A flash of understanding
passed between the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re right, Jamie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s a
right bonnie lass to carry on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, Nan and her friends were hurried
along by James Blake toward the carriage, and
in the moonlight, they drove up the steep hill toward
the gray castle on the summit.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>AN ACCIDENT NEAR THE CASTLE</small></h2>


<p>What a ride! Earlier in the evening, Grace had
called it spooky. Now she said nothing, but just
sat thinking, watching the tall old trees through
the carriage window as the equipage rumbled
along.</p>

<p>She thought of her mother and father and
Walter and of the coming meeting in London. She
thought of Nan and her brother and smiled.
She thought&mdash;but the thought winged away, as
the carriage swayed far over to the right, and
James Blake stuck his head out and shouted to the
driver, &ldquo;Be careful there!&rdquo; The carriage slowed
down. Grace breathed easier. Then the warning
was forgotten and the whole thing forged ahead
again, bumping over stones and rocks and ruts.</p>

<p>The horses seemed possessed. The old carriage
creaked and groaned under the strain. Momentarily,
the passengers felt that the whole thing would
topple over, or that the carriage, like the one-hoss
shay, would collapse into a thousand pieces. Grace
now was visibly frightened. Nan looked at her
anxiously and gave a warning look to Bess whom,
she was afraid, would break out in a tirade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
against the carelessness of the driver. Finally,
they rounded the sharp turn in the road which
Nan remembered as just preceding the castle
gates.</p>

<p>They all breathed easier. They could see the
castle now, beyond the gates and beyond the
drive. But just as they looked reassuringly at one
another, just as old James Blake murmured,
&ldquo;Home again,&rdquo; the carriage gave a sharp lurch.
The horses stopped suddenly, stumbled, regained
their balance, and then stood, shaking their heads
vigorously. The carriage gave one mighty shake,
shivered, and settled down to silence on its ancient
springs.</p>

<p>Inside, the occupants were jolted one on top of
the other. The girls unscrambled quickly. Young
and hardy, the jolt did not hurt them, but old
James Blake had toppled over so that he was
lying senseless against the door.</p>

<p>Nan knelt down beside him. She pulled out a
handkerchief and pushed his tousled hair back
from his face. There was an ugly gash in his
forehead. Dr. Prescott felt his pulse. It was faint.
Together, they raised him to the seat.</p>

<p>They called for the coachman. There was no
answer. They exchanged significant glances. &ldquo;Do
you suppose he was hurt, too?&rdquo; Grace could
hardly speak she was so frightened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Laura made a move to get out, but as she did
so old James Blake stirred. &ldquo;Dinna go out there,&rdquo;
he murmured as he slowly opened his eyes. He
looked around. His eyes found Nan and he
reached out and touched her. &ldquo;I dinna ken what
it&rsquo;s all aboot,&rdquo; he said weakly and seemed about
to drop off again. He caught himself.</p>

<p>He raised his hand and tried to push the door
open. It was stuck. He knocked at it weakly with
his fist. Then he kicked at it and it flew open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, up there,&rdquo; he called to the coachman.</p>

<p>There was no answer. He got out, slowly and
painfully. Nan followed and took his arm. He
patted hers reassuringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better take care, lass,&rdquo; he murmured, half
stumbling, half walking around to the front of the
coach. Nan shook herself impatiently as an eerie
feeling came over her. Nevertheless, it was comforting
to hear someone descend from the coach
at her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Nan.&rdquo; Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s voice came
through the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; It was Laura&rsquo;s tone, low
and confident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; Nan called back. She stood
now, next to James Blake looking up at the coachman&rsquo;s
seat. It was empty!</p>

<p>What had happened? A number of possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
flashed through Nan&rsquo;s mind as she moved closer
to James Blake. Had the driver been hurt and
fallen down the other side? Had he jumped down
and run away after the carriage stopped so suddenly?
Had&mdash;had he been in the carriage at all
during the wild drive up the hill?</p>

<p>She followed James Blake as he picked his way
carefully around the whinnying horses. Was this
all a part of the strange series of events that had
seemed to pursue her ever since she knew for certain
that she was to make this trip?</p>

<p>Nan stepped up beside the old Scotsman when
he paused to examine the feet of one of the horses
in passing. What did he know about all of this?
She determined to ask him when they were alone
again. Now, she took comfort in noting the kindly
expression on his face as he rubbed the head of
one of the horses that seemed to be hurt. The
animal nuzzled his nose in the master&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy now,&rdquo; he encouraged and almost at once
the animals stopped the impatient shaking of their
heads.</p>

<p>They reached the other side of the coachman&rsquo;s
seat and fearfully looked around. There was nothing
there. They walked back over the road for
several yards. Still they found no signs of the
missing person.</p>

<p>James Blake scratched his head reflectively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; he took Nan&rsquo;s hand firmly in his,
&ldquo;come, stay close to me and we&rsquo;ll clear this mystery
up.&rdquo; His voice sounded confident, but inside
he was sure, as sure as he was of anything that this
was no mere accident.</p>

<p>He felt the warmness of Nan&rsquo;s hand in his. He
noted her apparent fearlessness. &ldquo;The lass should
never have been allowed to come to Emberon,&rdquo; he
thought and was annoyed that his own desire to
see her had allowed him, in the early months of
the year, to persuade himself that it would be
all right.</p>

<p>Why hadn&rsquo;t he allowed the Edinburgh solicitors
who had handled the estate carry out the final
terms of the will of old Hugh without his meddling?
Ah, but it was too late to think of that now.
She was here and had to stay, at least for the
night. Perhaps tomorrow he could send her on to
Edinburgh. But now, now it was best to get her
mind off this&mdash;accident. It was best to get her
back in her apartment at Emberon. He could
guard her there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, lass,&rdquo; he spoke, as he turned from his
search along the side of the road, &ldquo;these things
are not for young ladies. You and your friends
must go back to the house. We&rsquo;ll let someone from
there make the necessary inquiry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what if the coachman is lying along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
road, hurt?&rdquo; Nan protested. &ldquo;If we wait, it might
be too late to help him. Please, let me look down
the road a way further.&rdquo; She almost wrenched
her hand free from his as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a brave lass,&rdquo; he complimented her.
Nevertheless he didn&rsquo;t let her go. He turned
abruptly and started back toward the carriage.
Against her will, she went along with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find him?&rdquo; Laura was waiting beside
the door of the carriage as they came up to it
again.</p>

<p>Nan shook her head. What was this all about?
Why had old James Blake stopped the search for
the missing coachman so suddenly? Exhausted
from the day&rsquo;s events, the landing at Glasgow, the
trip to Emberon, the excitement over the Scotch
games, and then this mystery, she felt impatient
with the old gentleman. She was still afraid that
the coachman lay out there in the dark somewhere,
injured.</p>

<p>Her feeling of impatience continued as James
hustled the girls into the carriage, closed the door
after them, and then walked alone to the big gate
and pulled three times on the big bell rope.</p>

<p>In the stillness of the night, the girls, huddled
in the carriage, could hear very faintly the sound
of the bell up at the big house. Then they heard,
or thought they heard, the sound of a door, footsteps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and at long last, there was someone at the
gate. Though they couldn&rsquo;t see anyone, they knew
that James Blake was in whispered consultation.</p>

<p>Finally, there was the grating noise of the gates
swinging back on rusty hinges. James Blake sent
a man from the house to drive the carriage the
rest of the way. The girls were glad to hear the
slapping sound of the reins as the new driver put
them in place over the horses&rsquo; backs.</p>

<p>The carriage pulled out of a rut, lunged forward
and then came to a stop again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; The voice was that of the old steward.
The driver tried again. This time a horse
stumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa, there,&rdquo; James Blake ordered, &ldquo;we canna
drive them. The poor beastie is hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it happened that at sometime after midnight,
six Lakeview Hall girls and Dr. Prescott got out
of a carriage and walked along the lonely entrance
road to Emberon Castle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>JAMES BLAKE DOES SOME EXPLAINING</small></h2>


<p>They were all wary as they picked their way
over the dry rutted road, but Nan more so than
any of them. Even as James Blake felt responsible
for her, so she felt responsible for her friends.
There was small comfort now, in this lonely place,
in the memory that the hunchback had told Bess
that &ldquo;these things had no part of her.&rdquo; The accident,
if such it might be called, on the hill just
now, might very well have killed them all. Nan
shuddered as she thought of how serious it might
have been.</p>

<p>She peered this way and that into the tangle
of bushes, grass, and thistles along the way, not
knowing what she was looking for, but suspicious
of every dark shadow.</p>

<p>Once, she looked gratefully up at the sky, the
big moon, and the bright stars. She stumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No star gazing tonight,&rdquo; Laura steadied her
as she almost fell. &ldquo;And what a moon, and what
a sky, and what a shadow.&rdquo; Laura pointed off to
the right. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she whispered, half in fun,
half in seriousness, &ldquo;look, it&rsquo;s like a man carrying
something long in his hand.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s glance followed Laura&rsquo;s. The shadow&mdash;was
it a man&rsquo;s? She watched it. Was it moving?
Then she breathed a deep sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura,&rdquo; she chided her friend, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only
a tree! Will you stop teasing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was a tree?&rdquo; Grace was on edge too,
anxious to get inside, anxious to get away from
this castle that had seemed so wonderful and so
grand only a few hours ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Grace.&rdquo; Nan tried to keep her own
voice from seeming worried as she spoke.
&ldquo;Laura&rsquo;s seeing things in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace didn&rsquo;t answer, because she had been seeing
things too. In the face of Nan&rsquo;s quietness and
calmness, it did seem silly. With this thought, she
felt encouraged and looked more bravely around
her. An owl hooted. She jumped. All the girls
jumped. It was Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s voice this time that
calmed them down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost there, girls!&rdquo; her voice actually
sounded cheery in the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, and safely too.&rdquo; Old James Blake had
been particularly silent since they left the carriage.
Now, he spoke with a great sense of relief.
Already he could see that a door was open and
inside there was light and security.</p>

<p>He stepped his foot on the first of the broad
stone steps and stood there as the girls walked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
up through the door and into the light of the
great hall. After watching them disappear, he
turned, gave one last penetrating glance into the
night, but saw nothing to disturb him further. He
listened then for the sound of the horses, heard
one whinny. It was a rather pleasant, comforting
sound. He was satisfied that they were being
properly cared for, so he too walked up the steps,
conscious now for the first time that the wound in
his forehead ached and that his head hurt.</p>

<p>The pain angered him. Again he turned away
from the light. This time, he shook his fist at the
unseen forces out there in the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll not do her harm,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as long as
James Blake can fight.&rdquo; With this, he set his chin
firmly and followed the American lassies into the
castle.</p>

<p>Already, at Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s insistence they had
found their way to their rooms. She lingered in
the apartment until they had undressed and were
safely in bed. Then she herself carefully closed
their doors before she returned to the Hall where
James Blake was sitting before the big open fireplace,
puzzling over the whole situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your head, is it injured badly?&rdquo; There was a
real note of concern in her voice as she spoke. She
liked this old Scotsman, even if she couldn&rsquo;t
understand the ways of his household.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing at all,&rdquo; he waived all consideration
of himself. &ldquo;Are the lassies all right?&rdquo; He
nodded his head in the direction of the stairs.</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott knew by his tone that his entire
thought was for them. &ldquo;Quite all right at present,&rdquo;
she answered as she sat down in the chair he
had pulled out for her with a quaint courtly sort
of grace. &ldquo;Now, tell me,&rdquo; she entreated, &ldquo;what
is this all about? What happened down on the
hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t answer at once, but sat thinking.
Should he tell as much of the story as he knew?
Would it help or hinder this woman to know?
For a moment he sat appraising her. She looked
capable enough, he decided, but then, there was
no telling about women. He shook his head and
winced, without thinking, at the pain. After all,
he decided finally, this pleasant looking woman
was Nan&rsquo;s guardian in the absence of her mother
and father. It was only fair that she know everything
that he did. Then, too, if things worked out
rightly, she would have to be Nan&rsquo;s sponsor in
the whole London business.</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott, though she couldn&rsquo;t read his
thoughts exactly, knew, from her long experience
with people, approximately what was going on in
his mind. She sat silent while she saw him coming
to his decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Eventually, he spoke. &ldquo;You know, of course,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the story of Mrs. Sherwood&rsquo;s inheritance?&rdquo;
Dr. Prescott nodded her head. &ldquo;And why
Nancy is here?&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott was a little puzzled at this question.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she agreed slowly, &ldquo;to see the
estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in part.&rdquo; James Blake seemed to be feeling
his way along now. &ldquo;That is the reason that
was given, at least, for our anxiety to have her
come, that and the fact that we wanted to see her.
An old man&rsquo;s whim, you know, that is what Nan&rsquo;s
mother, bless her heart, thought. But actually,
there is more behind this than appears on the
surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Hugh Blake was more of a power in this
section of Scotland than most people of this generation
realize,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The Blake family,
in the beginning of Scotland&rsquo;s history, was, if you
will pardon my saying so, for I, too, am one of
his descendants, because of its wealth and intelligence,
very close to the royal family. However,
the old line gradually died out. This explains how
it happened Mrs. Sherwood inherited the estate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in the old days, when the clans hereabouts
practically ruled the country, the Blakes of Emberon
were frequently called to London to advise
the king&rsquo;s ministers. At such times they were generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
rewarded in one way or another. Sometimes
it was with land, sometimes with important foreign
posts, sometimes with court privileges that
were highly prized in those days. Yes, and highly
respected,&rdquo; he added, as the thought of the day&rsquo;s
happenings again crossed his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it happened that Hugh Blake the fourth,
the original Laird of Emberon&mdash;it was he who
built this Hall we are sitting in&mdash;back in the sixteenth
century performed a service to the King
that won for him an ambassadorship to France. It
was a particularly ticklish post then, for France
and Scotland and England were continually
having trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Hugh Blake, he is supposed to have
been a very charming young man at the time,
gifted and well-educated, became a favorite at the
French court, and well-beloved of the French
king. So it was, that once, in the tangled history
of the time, he succeeded in getting some concessions
from the French that were most advantageous
to the English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;London and the court there was so pleased
with young Hugh that they bestowed on him and
his descendants forever the privilege of assisting
at the coronation of English kings.&rdquo; His voice was
excited and nervous as he finished the sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand what I am saying?&rdquo; The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
man looked at Dr. Prescott intently. Then he
shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I don&rsquo;t make myself quite clear,&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;The simple fact is,&rdquo; he explained further,
&ldquo;that Mrs. Sherwood&rsquo;s inheritance carried with
it the right to assist at the present coronation!
Moreover, her great uncle, Hugh Blake, who got
his name from the old line, specified to those of
us who were his friends, that young Nan, if she
seemed to us to be worthy, should be the one to
carry on! That is why we wanted her to come.
That is why the villagers were so anxious to see
her. And that is why,&rdquo; he lowered his voice now,
&ldquo;I was fearful of her safety out there this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean there is some opposition?&rdquo; Dr.
Prescott asked when she found her voice after this
amazing story had been told.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, on the part of one or two,&rdquo; the old man
admitted, &ldquo;who think, and wrongly so, that if
some means can be found to prevent Nan&rsquo;s taking
part at the crowning this spring, they will be able
to prove their right to carry on when the court of
claims, where such things are argued before the
king&rsquo;s representatives, meets a few days hence in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Mrs. Sherwood know of all of this?&rdquo;
Dr. Prescott asked further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet. This portion of the inheritance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
bestowed under the terms of another will which
was put in my keeping by Hugh Blake. The Edinburgh
solicitors who handled the estate for Mrs.
Sherwood when she and her husband were here,
know this story I have told you, however. Even
now, they are awaiting word from me as to how
to proceed. They are anxious, too, for Nan to
come. Tonight, with your consent,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;I will send off a cable to America, explaining the
circumstances. We will not proceed until we hear
from Nancy&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somewhere in the large rooms of the old castle
a clock now chimed slowly, one, two, three.</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott looked at her watch. &ldquo;Will you
be so kind,&rdquo; she said as she arose from her chair,
&ldquo;as to wait and send that cable in the morning?
What you have told me here tonight has come so
unexpectedly that I&rsquo;d like an hour or two to think
it over before communicating with Nan&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t object,&rdquo; James Blake seemed
startled at the mere thought, &ldquo;to Nan&rsquo;s taking
part in the coronation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatsoever,&rdquo; Dr. Prescott hastened to
assure him. &ldquo;It will be a great privilege and honor
indeed, doubly so, because she is an American
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, that has been some of the cause for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
trouble,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with the people hereabouts.
They didn&rsquo;t want the honor to go across the seas.
But Nancy&rsquo;s mother, when she came over to take
possession of the estate quite won the heart of
everyone. Now Nancy has done the same. There
will be no more trouble of that sort,&rdquo; he promised,
&ldquo;and no more trouble of any kind, if I can
help it.&rdquo; He finished the sentence belligerently.</p>

<p>His own fighting mood brought back to Dr.
Prescott&rsquo;s mind the accident in the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know at all what happened tonight?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean what caused the accident?&rdquo; he parried,
for here was something he did not want to
talk about as yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not certain as yet,&rdquo; he admitted half the
truth, &ldquo;but if you will have faith in an old man
and leave your question rest for a few hours,&rdquo; he
was very serious as he spoke, &ldquo;I will answer it
later. There is no need for you to worry,&rdquo; he concluded.
With this he walked with her over to the
stairway and watched her as she went up.</p>

<p>Alone in the hall now, he rang a bell and called
for the servant who had been left with the carriage.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>NAN&rsquo;S DISAPPEARANCE</small></h2>


<p>Somewhere on the estate a cock crowed.</p>

<p>Nan stirred sleepily and turned over. The cock
crowed triumphantly again. Nan turned once
more and saw that the morning sun was filtering
in through the heavy drapes at the windows. She
rubbed her eyes and stretched. She looked
around. Where was she? Then she spied the ancestral
portraits frowning down upon her and she
remembered everything.</p>

<p>So she had slept after all! She remembered
vaguely an urge the night before to stay awake and
watch to see that nothing happened. Why, it was
music that had lulled her to sleep! She remembered
it now, the faint far away sound of a bagpipe
playing. It had been like a dream, for with
the wind around the castle and the creaking of the
old floors, she had been completely unable to follow
the thread of the tune. It had come, died
away, and come again. In trying to follow it, she
had fallen asleep at last.</p>

<p>Now she lay listening. There were no sounds
at all to be heard in the old castle. She got up
quietly, slipped into her robe and slippers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
walked softly over to the windows, careful all the
while not to disturb anyone. She pulled the curtains
back and stood looking down on the castle
grounds, seeing them in the daylight for the first
time.</p>

<p>The big gray stone building she was in, she
could see now, was built on a pinnacle so that on
all sides there were valleys below. She remembered
what Dr. Beulah had said the night before
about the old castles. Now she saw in imagination
the leaders of clans in days gone by standing
where she was, watching the approach of the
enemy below.</p>

<p>She peopled the towers that she could see with
beautiful princesses, the crumbling walls of the
older unused parts of the castle with knights in
armor, singing, talking, laughing, and fighting.
She imagined all sorts of plots and counterplots,
and now in the valleys there was grain growing
and cattle grazing! How pretty it looked in the
early morning sunshine! So different than it had
seemed the night before!</p>

<p>Now she thought again of the accident on the
hill. What had caused it? Could she learn more by
daylight than she had been able to by night? A
bird sang cheerily outside. Another flew across her
line of vision. Everything seemed to be beckoning
her to come out and explore. She turned from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
window and dressed hastily. Perhaps she could
solve last night&rsquo;s mystery by going down the hill.
Perhaps she could solve it and set everyone&rsquo;s mind
at rest!</p>

<p>She opened the door carefully and walked
slowly down the big staircase into the Great Hall.
There James Blake was asleep before the big fireplace
where the embers of last night&rsquo;s fire were
still burning. She saw that his head was bandaged
and that he looked tired and worried, even in
sleep. She couldn&rsquo;t know that he had dropped off
only a half hour before from sheer exhaustion. He
had spent the few hours remaining after his talk
with Dr. Prescott and his servant in personally
watching to see that nothing further happened.</p>

<p>Now, as he slept, she walked quietly past his
back. He stirred and muttered something. She
stopped. He sank back into quiet sleep and she
went on and out, opening the door carefully and
closing it the same.</p>

<p>James Blake stirred again and awakened then
with a start. He looked around. &ldquo;Auld fool!&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Sleeping, when ye&rsquo;d set yourself to
watch those lassies.&rdquo; He got up and walked
around the room. Everything seemed to be all
right. Stiff from his night in the chair he stretched,
threw a knotted log of wood on the fire, and then
rang for a servant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The young lassies upstairs are tired,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;See that everything is kept quiet so they will
sleep until late. Before the day is over, they will
be off to Edinburgh.&rdquo; So it was not until hours
after she had slipped through the door, walked
down the road past the bushes that had seemed
such a menace the night before, and passed
through the gate, that Nan&rsquo;s disappearance was
discovered.</p>

<p>It was Bess who missed her first. Awakening
much later than Nan, she lay for some time enjoying
the luxury of the room in which she slept.
She noted every detail of the furnishings and determined
that when she returned to school in the
fall, nothing of all this would be lost in the telling.
She half hoped that she would have the opportunity
to tell Linda Riggs. In her mind&rsquo;s eye, she
picked out one or two others that she would like
to impress. No one that she knew, she thought
with satisfaction, had ever even seen such a place
as this old castle, much less stayed in one.</p>

<p>The more she thought of it, the grander it
seemed. A little feeling of envy came over her.
Why was it that the nice things that happened to
Nan never happened to her? Why couldn&rsquo;t her
father or mother have a place like this? Bess was
a thoughtless unappreciative little person at times.
Though her father and mother gave her everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
within their means, she was still dissatisfied.
Her hand touched the satin cover that was over
her. As quickly as the feeling of envy had come,
it went. She listened for sounds. Was Nan awake
in the next room?</p>

<p>She got up and stuck her head in through the
door. The bed was empty! Was everyone except
herself up? She went across the hall to Laura&rsquo;s
room, and found her still sleeping. She looked in
the big double room where Amelia and Grace
were. They were sleeping too. So was Rhoda. She
debated once as to whether or not she should look
into Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s apartment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to do
that,&rdquo; she decided, &ldquo;Nan&rsquo;s probably downstairs
waiting for us. Maybe she will come up, if I stay
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went back into her own room, and because
she was cold, she crawled back into bed.
But then her curiosity as to Nan&rsquo;s whereabouts
got the better of her. Maybe Nan was out exploring!
It would be fun to walk around the castle
grounds!</p>

<p>She dressed almost as quickly as Nan had,
slipped out quietly too, and went downstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, lassie,&rdquo; James Blake greeted her as she
entered the big hall. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re up bright and early
this morning.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not the first,&rdquo; Bess smiled back,
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the lass is still asleep,&rdquo; he began heartily,
and then noting the puzzled expression on
Bess&rsquo;s face, he added, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; A world of
possibilities came to his mind as he asked the question
and he repeated it before Bess could answer.
&ldquo;Tell me quickly, isn&rsquo;t she upstairs? Isn&rsquo;t she with
her other friends, with the school mistress? Isn&rsquo;t
she about up there some place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was frightened too now and turned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
ask Dr. Prescott,&rdquo; she called over her shoulder
as she went up the stairs. &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, lass, and be quick!&rdquo; Old James Blake
followed her half way up the stairs.</p>

<p>But Dr. Prescott, awake herself in her apartment,
heard their voices, and came out on the
landing. &ldquo;Is there anything wrong?&rdquo; Before the
question was answered, she knew the response.
&ldquo;Nan&rsquo;s missing!&rdquo; For a moment the two older
people stood with Bess between them looking
hopelessly into one another&rsquo;s faces. Then they all
got busy.</p>

<p>A hurried check of Nan&rsquo;s room showed that
what they feared most had not happened. The
young girl had left the apartment of her own accord.
She had not been kidnapped, at least not
while in her room. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably just gone exploring.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Bess took the whole thing calmly at first,
for she knew Nan&rsquo;s habits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, maybe so,&rdquo; old James Blake agreed, &ldquo;but
&rsquo;tis better to have her here with us. We&rsquo;ll all do
our exploring together.&rdquo; With this, he called the
servants and tried to check on Nan&rsquo;s movements.
No one had seen her.</p>

<p>A search was organized. Everyone was sent to
a different part of the estate. Old James Blake
himself climbed to the top of the highest tower
and looked out over the grounds. He came down
sadly.</p>

<p>There was no Nan to be seen or found anyplace.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>BESS HAS HER SAY</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe things won&rsquo;t turn out all
right!&rdquo; Bess exclaimed, as she and her other
Lakeview Hall friends sat together in Nan&rsquo;s room
in the great castle. &ldquo;And I hate having to stay
here! I don&rsquo;t see why they can&rsquo;t let us help too!
After all, Nan&rsquo;s our friend and if she is in trouble,
we ought to be allowed to help her get out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Bess,&rdquo; Rhoda spoke softly, &ldquo;they told us
to stay here so that we would be handy in case we
were needed. I&rsquo;m sure that if there was anything
at all in the world that we could do, Dr. Prescott
would call us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; Bess answered. &ldquo;She
treats us most of the time as though we were
babies. It happens this time,&rdquo; she continued with
some satisfaction, &ldquo;that we know more than anyone
about what has been going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Laura spoke up now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing,&rdquo; Bess began, &ldquo;we know
about the hunchback and nobody else does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he has anything to do with
this?&rdquo; Laura looked at Bess intently. &ldquo;After all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
you know, no one is certain but what Nan has just
gone out and lost herself. You all know how she
likes to wander around strange places by herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that downstairs, myself,&rdquo; Bess answered,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe it at all. Nan
wouldn&rsquo;t worry us like this. Moreover, when we
got on the train at Glasgow I thought I saw that
old hunchback getting on, too. I didn&rsquo;t say anything
about it then, because I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil
the good time we were having. But I&rsquo;m sure I saw
him.&rdquo; She waited, watching the effect of her announcement
on the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it,&rdquo; Laura got up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
right downstairs now and tell them about him.
Maybe it will help them to find Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do that.&rdquo; It was Bess who stopped
her. &ldquo;We promised Nan we wouldn&rsquo;t say anything
about him and we&rsquo;re not going to. Anyway,
Dr. Prescott would be angry to know that those
things happened on the boat and that we didn&rsquo;t
tell her. You know she would, and it would spoil
all the rest of our trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Bess is right,&rdquo; Grace agreed timidly.
&ldquo;Maybe we had just better wait for a while and
see what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for two hours,&rdquo; Amelia looked at
her watch, &ldquo;and if Nan hasn&rsquo;t come back by then,
I think we should tell everything we know. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
really might help Mr. Blake. He seems terribly
worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s something more to this than we
know about, I&rsquo;m sure. I heard Dr. Prescott and
him talking about sending for some people in the
village to help join in the search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they done it?&rdquo; Bess asked quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; Laura answered. &ldquo;She
asked him to wait, to give Nan time to come back
if she had wandered off by herself. She doesn&rsquo;t
want any of this to get into the newspapers, if she
can help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it does, it will frighten all our people
back home and we&rsquo;ll have to go back right away,
I know,&rdquo; Bess was worried at this thought. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t Nan stay here with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we ought to tell all that we know
now,&rdquo; Rhoda returned to the question that had
been set aside a few moments before. &ldquo;It certainly
can&rsquo;t do any harm. Dr. Prescott probably will
scold us, but that&rsquo;s nothing beside the risk of
harming Nan by not telling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rhoda&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Laura got up once more, &ldquo;and
I don&rsquo;t care what the rest of you think, I&rsquo;m going
downstairs now and tell. I just can&rsquo;t stand sitting
here any longer and not doing anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; Bess gave in, for she too was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
becoming tired of just waiting. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go down
together. Are the rest of you agreed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace still seemed reluctant to go, for she was
one to obey orders and felt that if the people
downstairs wanted them, they would call. She
said something of this to her friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grace, don&rsquo;t be so afraid,&rdquo; Laura was
impatient with her now, &ldquo;You can just bet that, if
they thought we had anything at all worth telling,
they would have asked us long ago. Now, come
on, don&rsquo;t be a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn&rsquo;t worth telling.&rdquo; Grace was
growing stubborn now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is,&rdquo; Laura replied to this,
&ldquo;that if the fact that a mysterious person went
through Nan&rsquo;s luggage once and then followed
her from the time we got off the boat until we got
here isn&rsquo;t worth telling, then nothing is. Now,
come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no more argument. Together the
girls went downstairs to where James Blake and
Dr. Prescott were holding consultation with two
villagers who had been called in when Dr. Prescott
had finally given her consent to ask for outside
help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; James Blake was saying, as
they entered, &ldquo;the lassie has gone off by herself
and been lost. There is to be no word of anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
else told to anyone, but we want a thorough
search made of every likely hiding place in the
neighborhood. No one would hurt her, but as you
both know, there might be good reason to keep
her in hiding until after the good king is crowned.
Now, mind you, hold your tongues, and report
back to me as quickly&mdash;&rdquo; He left the sentence unfinished
as he saw the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it lassies?&rdquo; He smiled reassuringly
down at them.</p>

<p>Laura plunged into her story without any preliminaries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he was&mdash;a hunchback&mdash;red headed&mdash;with
strange eyes?&rdquo; The old man seemed to grow
much older even as he repeated the words. &ldquo;Then
it is as I feared. The man we want is Robert Hugh
Blake, my own poor, misguided brother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rubbed his hand across his face, as he
spoke. For a moment, he looked as though the
whole thing was more than he could possibly
stand.</p>

<p>Those in the room watched him silently, feeling
at once how deeply he was hurt. To Bess
alone, the name, Robert Hugh Blake, had a familiar
ring. As she heard it, her thoughts flashed
back to the last day on the boat when she had
surprised the hunchback at Nan&rsquo;s luggage. She
remembered Nan&rsquo;s revelation then, remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
her own puzzling over a clue that just escaped her
memory.</p>

<p>Now, she puckered her brows over it again
and tried to go back further over the things that
had happened. There! No, it didn&rsquo;t quite come.
She tried harder, sure now that the fact that was
escaping her had an important bearing upon the
present mystery. She went back in time over the
scenes on the boat, their farewells to their parents,
the trip to New York, the last days at school,
the worry when for so long they didn&rsquo;t receive any
letters&mdash;</p>

<p>There, she had it now! It was a letter, the mysterious
letter Nan had read in their room at Lakeview!
It was the letter Nan had refused to explain,
although it had left her nervous and
excited! Bess remembered the scene all quite
clearly now. She knew now, as she knew then, that
Nan&rsquo;s explanation that it made her homesick
wasn&rsquo;t the truth. She knew that that letter had
been the beginning of all their troubles!</p>

<p>Without thinking further, she blurted out what
she knew about it. James Blake, Dr. Prescott,
everyone in the room listened intently to everything
that Bess had to say. For once, she made a
clean breast of everything and told all that she
knew of what had been happening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where, lassie, is that letter?&rdquo; James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Blake made a distinct effort to forget his own
sorrow at the turn of events. Action was needed
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, unless it is in her bags,&rdquo; Bess
started upstairs at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go look.&rdquo; At last
she felt important, as though she was doing her
part to help locate Nan.</p>

<p>But much as she wanted to, she couldn&rsquo;t find
the note in question. She looked over everything
most thoroughly, admiring, even in her excitement,
the extreme neatness of Nan&rsquo;s bags. But
she found nothing unusual at all. She went slowly
back downstairs and reported.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the letter at all?&rdquo; Dr. Prescott
questioned her, &ldquo;the envelope, the stamps,
or the postmark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess shook her head, wishing now that when
she had first noticed Nan sitting troubled over it,
she had insisted on knowing what it was all about.
&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been so interested in that old memory
book,&rdquo; she thought regretfully, &ldquo;I might have
known more now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But regrets were of no use, now. All in the
room felt regrets in one form or another, but that
did not bring Nan back.</p>

<p>Old James Blake had sat silently by, during Dr.
Prescott&rsquo;s questioning, knowing that she thought
as he did, that the letter Nan had received in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Lakeview was some sort of warning as to what
would happen to her, if she left the United States.
He knew, too, that in asking about the postmark,
she was trying to find out whether or not it had
been mailed in Scotland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one thing to do,&rdquo; he spoke
rather sadly, &ldquo;and much as I hate to have it happen,
I must tell you to do it. You must ring that
bell over there, call for a servant, and either go
yourself or have him go and report this whole
thing to the authorities. It&rsquo;s a case, I think, for
Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure that that is the only course?&rdquo;
Dr. Prescott was most sympathetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;My
brother, the one whom you all call the hunchback,
was injured during the late war so that he was
deformed for life and his mind was affected. He
has, since his discharge from the hospital, been a
recluse, refusing to see anyone except myself and
a very few friends. He has spent most of his time
searching old family records with the aim in view
of writing a family history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has always loved this estate and felt, for
no very good reason, that he and I were the logical
heirs. When it passed to someone across the
water, the blow almost killed him. However, he
recovered, and we kept him under close guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
when Nancy&rsquo;s parents were here some time ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently, after their departure, since they
left the care of the place in our hands, he was
resigned to what had happened. However, when
the old king died and he saw that our old Scotch
privilege of taking part in the coronation was
given to an American, the old wound was reopened.
For days he was like a mad man around
here. Then he quieted down, and I thought that
he was accepting fate again. When he disappeared
some weeks ago, I made a quiet search. Unable to
find out anything, I let the matter rest, hoping
against hope that he had gone into retirement as
he often has in recent years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What must have happened you know as well
as I. That he is somewhere in this vicinity, I am
certain, as certain as I am that he was the driver
of the coach last night on the wild drive up the
hill. Why it was that he stopped, that he didn&rsquo;t
carry out what I think was his original intention,
to drive you all over the embankment, I can only
guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t for fear of losing his own life, I
know. I believe that it was concern for me. We
have always been very fond of one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this last simply, and made a motion, as
no one else moved, to go himself and pull the bell
chord.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>NAN COMES INTO HER OWN</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Dr. Prescott gave the command as the
old Scotsman raised his arm to pull the chord.
&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one impulse, everyone in the room turned
toward the door. They were all tense as it was
opened from without and a group of villagers entered
with Robert Hugh Blake in their midst!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he was protesting, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
where the lassie is.&rdquo; His eyes were wild and staring
as he spoke. &ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke
off his sentence when his eyes lighted on his
brother. His whole attitude changed. &ldquo;James, I
don&rsquo;t know where she is,&rdquo; he almost whimpered.</p>

<p>James Blake stepped over to his brother&rsquo;s side.
He motioned to the others in the room to keep
quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, Bobby,&rdquo; he spoke as he would
to a child, &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t know where she
is now. But where was she when you last saw
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down in the old gatehouse at the foot of the
hill.&rdquo; Robert Blake answered. He was accustomed
to obeying his brother. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t hurt her, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
at all.&rdquo; His voice was earnest as he spoke and so
sincere, that even Dr. Prescott, worried as she
was, believed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was there playing on the bagpipe,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;as I always do, when she came in through
the door. I swear that that&rsquo;s the truth. She sat
and talked to me for a long time. She&rsquo;s a sweet
little lassie. Then I excused myself and went out
for something, telling her that I would be right
back. But I locked the door behind me. I was
going to keep her there until it was too late for
you to find her, but I had forgotten something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he paused as though he couldn&rsquo;t remember what
it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your bagpipe,&rdquo; James Blake supplied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was it. It was my bagpipe,&rdquo; he went
on looking at his brother throughout his confession.
&ldquo;When I opened the door again, she wasn&rsquo;t
there! How she got away I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do!&rdquo; James Blake&rsquo;s exclamation fell
like a thunderbolt on the rapt listeners. &ldquo;I know
where she is,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll have her
here in a minute now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have who?&rdquo; Everyone look around startled.
It was Nan&rsquo;s voice!</p>

<p>James Blake went over to her side. &ldquo;Then you
found it, lass! You found it!&rdquo; His voice rang out
through the Hall. &ldquo;I might have known you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
find it!&rdquo; In his joy, he forgot completely that the
assembled crowd didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Found what?&rdquo; Dr. Prescott asked the question
everyone had on his tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The passage, the secret passage from the old
gatehouse to the castle here,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Only
a few know of its existence. Evidently my brother
here has forgotten. How did you find it, lass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; Nan admitted. &ldquo;When I
found myself locked up, I tried all sorts of ways
of getting out without any success at all. I was
standing on a chair and trying to climb to that
window high above&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible, lass,&rdquo; James Blake interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nan agreed, &ldquo;but I was so anxious
to get out of there that nothing seemed impossible.
Climbing up as I did, I felt closer to the
outside anyway. I thought, too, that there was a
slight chance of my getting hold of those rough
stones that the walls are made of in such a way
that I could climb up to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, of course, but in trying, my foot
slipped into a nick of some kind in the wall. I
pressed down hard on it, hoping to boost myself
up. I couldn&rsquo;t. I slipped. I fell. When I picked
myself up, I saw that a sliding panel on the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
wall had moved to one side leaving a great
opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went through. It closed then. I walked on
through the dark, and after what seemed ages, I
came to the end. I groped around, knowing that
there had to be something to make another panel
move. Finally, I found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you did, lass,&rdquo; James Blake was beaming
on her now, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s not another in England
or Scotland or America either that would
have found the same. I am proud of you, so proud
of you that I&rsquo;d like to have you stay here always.
But that&rsquo;s not to be. Already there are things
afoot that require your presence and the presence
of your friends in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In London! I know, but we&rsquo;re not leaving
here yet, are we?&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s voice was almost pleading.
&ldquo;Not when we&rsquo;ve just come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, lass, that you are.&rdquo; James Blake was
regretful, too. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be coming back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why, why must we leave so soon?&rdquo; Nan
had learned just enough in her morning adventures
about the grounds to make her want to explore
every inch of the old castle. She had even
considered, on her walk down the road and
through the fields to the fateful gatehouse, the
possibility of staying in Emberon through the
coronation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>She had toyed with the idea of giving up the
great London celebration so that she could live in
the castle for a while. She had dismissed the
thought, of course. Mr. and Mrs. Mason and
Walter were to be in London. She was to meet the
friends she had made on the boat there, and the
London celebration at the crowning of the new
King and Queen would be, she knew, grander than
anything she had ever seen.</p>

<p>She wanted to go on to London and she wanted
to stay here in Emberon, too! These things all
rushed through her mind as she stood in the great
old Hall talking to James Blake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, lass,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to go.
There&rsquo;s something waiting there for you that&rsquo;s
far greater than anything that&rsquo;s ever happened to
you before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, in America, I don&rsquo;t know what you play
when you are wee tots, but the children here are
kings and queens when they play. A wooden box
is their throne. With a lace curtain as a train for
the queen then, and gold paper for a crown, they
have all the trappings of royalty. All take part.
Some are aids to the king. Others, to the queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They live and breathe this from the time they
first begin to notice things around them. So when
the old king dies and the new king and queen come
to live at Buckingham Palace and go to Westminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Cathedral to have the state crowns, gold
with all sorts of precious jewels in them, put on
their heads and the state swords put in their
hands, then all the wee tots pretend they are
ladies-in-waiting to the queen or gentlemen attendants
of the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they see the grand pictures every place
of the crowning at Westminster, they imagine
themselves giving a sword to the king or helping
to arrange the train of the queen. Aye, in imagination
they are all there in that beautiful Cathedral
helping with the service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But actually, only a few are so honored in real
life. The privilege to assist at the crowning of
the English king is passed down by great families
from generation to generation.&rdquo; He paused here
to let the young lassies get the full importance of
his words.</p>

<p>Nan looked from him to her friends. What was
this all about? What did it have to do with her
going to London? Dr. Prescott seemed to know!
She was smiling down at Nan. The other girls,
did they know, too? They seemed to understand.
Their faces were radiant as the old Scotsman
spoke, for the truth is, they were understanding
for the first time what James Blake had meant an
hour before. He had said something then about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the privilege of taking part in the coronation going
across the water. Could he have meant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Now they all looked up at him as he concluded.
&ldquo;Nancy dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as you know, the old
Blake line has died out. Those who would have
carried out the ancient privilege of assisting at the
present crowning in London are dead. However,
under terms of the will of the late Hugh Blake,
you&rdquo; he spoke low and slowly now, but very distinctly,
&ldquo;are chosen to act as a lady-in-waiting to
the queen, God bless her soul! That is why you
must be off to London now.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>LONDON ON HOLIDAY</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to do it!&rdquo; Nan was up in her
room in the old castle, packing, when she made
this astonishing remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nancy Sherwood, how you talk!&rdquo; Bess
just wouldn&rsquo;t believe that anyone could be so foolish
as to mean what her closest friend had just
said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be in Westminster
Cathedral with all those lords and ladies, ambassadors
and ministers, kings and queens, when they
crown the English king and queen? Why, Nan,
you don&rsquo;t mean that at all. You know you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do too mean it.&rdquo; Nan&rsquo;s chin was firm and
her voice very positive as she spoke. &ldquo;I want to
be with all of you, just as we had planned, when
we are in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; Bess paused in her packing to
look at her friend. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a better time than
any of us can ever hope to have. If I didn&rsquo;t like
you so much, I&rsquo;d just be green with envy. Think
of it! You&rsquo;ll see the whole royal family and talk
to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a long white court dress like those
we have been seeing in the papers. You&rsquo;ll be driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
up to Westminster in a carriage behind the royal
coach and you&rsquo;ll go in there and see everything
that we can only read about. And if you don&rsquo;t remember
every single detail of what happens, I&rsquo;ll
never speak to you again!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see all the court dresses, the ermine
capes, the little coronets of the peeresses, and the
grand coronation robes of the king and queen.
You&rsquo;ll see the little prince and princess, the duchess
and her handsome husband, and that new
Ambassador from the United States that everyone
is talking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see them all and talk to them. Why, it&rsquo;s
all something to dream about and here it&rsquo;s happened
to you! Oh, Nan, I&rsquo;m so excited I could
cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, Bess,&rdquo; Laura came into the
room, &ldquo;if you cry all over that taffeta dress you
are packing, you&rsquo;ll die of grief and never see Nan
in all her glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan,&rdquo; she turned to her friend, &ldquo;you run
along downstairs. They want you. I&rsquo;ll finish your
packing and don&rsquo;t you dare let anyone at all hear
you say what I heard you say to Bess about not
wanting to be a lady-in-waiting to the queen! Forsooth!
They hang people for less or else they
throw them into musty old dungeons and let them
die. It would be a shame to have you pining away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in a prison, while we were sitting in the pleasant
May sunshine watching golden coaches full of fair
ladies drive by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be good from now on,&rdquo; Nan promised
as she disappeared down the stairs.</p>

<p>There, everything was in a turmoil, and Nan
was the center of it all. It was, &ldquo;Nan, darling,
here&rsquo;s a cable from your mother,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lass, a telegram
from Edinburgh,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Miss Nan, a phone
call from London,&rdquo; and a thousand and one other
exciting things until Nan didn&rsquo;t know which way
to turn next.</p>

<p>Then she was whisked off with her friends to a
train. They had a private coach this time, one
provided by the village of Emberon from the
funds collected at the celebration on the night of
Nan&rsquo;s arrival. The whole town turned out to see
them off. There was music and laughter and good
wishes all round and a promise exacted from Nan
to come back again.</p>

<p>James Blake was the last to bid her good-by.
He pushed her through the crowd that swarmed
about her on the station steps, took her into her
coach, and seated her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, lass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;forget the unpleasant
things that have happened and remember that
Emberon is your home, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan nodded her head, and swallowed the lump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
that was in her throat. She couldn&rsquo;t speak. The
excitement in leaving the castle and listening now
to all the nice things that were being said was
almost too much.</p>

<p>The old man understood her feelings, so without
waiting for her to answer, he went on. &ldquo;When
you are down there in London, don&rsquo;t forget that
the Blakes are a proud lot and that on this occasion,
you are their representative. If you find that
I can help you further, call me by phone. I&rsquo;d give
the world to be there,&rdquo; he added longingly, &ldquo;but
other matters that you know about keep me here.
My brother must be taken care of now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, lass,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;do your best and make
us all proud of you.&rdquo; With this, he kissed her
lightly on the cheek and left her. The last thing
that she saw clearly on the station steps, as the
great engine gathered speed, was old James Blake
waving goodby with a big white handkerchief.
The last thing that she heard was the refrain of
&ldquo;The Bonnie, Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember now,&rdquo; Nan exclaimed, when
the last cottage in the village had disappeared
from view, &ldquo;I remember what it was that poor
old Robert Blake was playing on his bagpipe! It
was that song they were just singing back there.
And that was the song that I heard last night when
I dropped off to sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that must be the lake he was telling me
about this morning in the gatehouse when he told
me something of his boyhood. He said he couldn&rsquo;t
remember the name of the place where he used
to go so many times alone when he was a lad, to
read and write and dream, but that he was sure
that it was beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said that there was a mountain by a lake
that had clear green water in it. He said that once
when he was there, he came upon a camp of
gypsies and that the old queen told his fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; Bess asked when it
seemed that Nan wasn&rsquo;t going to go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She told him all about his youth,&rdquo; Nan continued
rather sadly, &ldquo;and then about the war.
After that she stopped. She said that she couldn&rsquo;t
be sure whether he was going to live through it
or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; Nan looked away from the girls
and out the windows at the landscape skimming
by, as she finished, &ldquo;I feel so sorry for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Grace agreed. &ldquo;But, tell us, Nan,
why was it he insisted on searching through your
baggage the way he did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grace, he wanted to get that letter I told
Mr. Blake about,&rdquo; Bess answered the question.
&ldquo;What I want to know is, what became of it?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what in the world was in it?&rdquo; Laura
contributed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had it with me when you were hunting for
it,&rdquo; Nan explained, &ldquo;and as for what was in it&mdash;it
was a warning that if I came to Scotland and to
Emberon that I&rsquo;d never live to see the coronation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan! And you didn&rsquo;t say a word to anyone
about it!&rdquo; Bess felt like scolding her friend. &ldquo;You
might have been killed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I was foolish,&rdquo; Nan admitted. &ldquo;And
I hereby promise never to do anything like that
again,&rdquo; she ended solemnly.</p>

<p>So, all the way to London, the girls talked of
things that had happened and things that were
going to happen. Their one big regret was the
fact that they weren&rsquo;t going to see Edinburgh on
this trip. Messrs. Kellam and Blake, attorneys
for the Emberon estate, had insisted that Nan go
directly to London to present her claims to assist
at the coronation.</p>

<p>The next morning found them rolling into Euston
Station where Walter, Mr. and Mrs. Mason,
and Professor Krenner were all waiting for them.
How good it seemed to see familiar faces!</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, this is the very nicest part of the trip!&rdquo;
Nan exclaimed and then blushed when she saw
that Walter&rsquo;s eyes were upon her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The others were bundled into a taxi, but Walter
insisted that Nan go in his car to her hotel. So
her first sight of London and the River Thames
was with Walter, a fact that she was never to
forget in her whole long happy life.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Nan Sherwood and
her friends were in a constant whirl. There were
a million things to be done and a million places to
go, and they wanted to do everything and go
every place.</p>

<p>With banners flying from all the buildings,
bunting draped across streets, and wreathes bearing
portraits of the king and queen hanging every
place, London was in a festive mood. The streets
were thronged with people of all nationalities.
Troops from all over the British Empire, to the
number of 50,000, added color and gaiety to the
crowd.</p>

<p>Every hotel in the great city was filled to capacity.
Big ships lay at anchor in the port, floating
hotels for visitors from Australia, South Africa,
the American continents, the West Indies, from
the remotest corners of the globe.</p>

<p>During the day, all these people poured out
into the streets. With bands playing, troops
marching, parades wherever you looked, it was
all very gay and exciting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything like this in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
whole life?&rdquo; Nan looked about and laughed.
Walter was at her side, making way for her, as
she pushed her way through the crowds outside
the royal offices where the court of claims had
just met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Princess,&rdquo; Walter grinned down at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t call me that,&rdquo; Nan protested.
&ldquo;Really, I sometimes feel awfully silly about this
whole business. Imagine me acting as lady-in-waiting
to a queen. Did you see all those people
stare at me in there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t staring. They were admiring
you.&rdquo; Walter could be gallant at times. Now he
was secretly a little awed at the turn of events,
impressed by Nan&rsquo;s new importance, for her claim
had been presented to the solemn be-wigged court
and accepted.</p>

<p>She was to assist at the coronation and, according
to an ancient ruling, receive in payment eight
seats inside Westminster to be distributed as she
willed! Their promised seats in Piccadilly, obtained
by Mr. Mason, had been of the best, but
these, these were priceless! It was impossible to
buy them. They could be obtained only through a
special grant from the king, even as Nan had received
hers.</p>

<p>Now, she could hardly wait as Walter drove
slowly along with the left hand traffic that is peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to London. She had seats, she thought to herself,
for Bess, Laura, Amelia, Rhoda, Grace and
Walter&mdash;how nice he was being to her!&mdash;Dr.
Prescott, and Professor Krenner, and she wanted
to tell them all right away!</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>THE KING IS CROWNED!</small></h2>


<p>The day of the coronation came at last. It was
a bright clear day, king&rsquo;s weather the Londoners
called it.</p>

<p>The streets all along the route of the procession
were crowded with great masses of people,
held back from the road by London bobbies. They
hung out of windows, sat in trees, covered the
tops of buildings, and filled immense grandstands.
Some of them had been in their places all night.
Others, long before dawn, had found their way
through the dark streets. It seemed as though all
the world was there, waiting expectantly for the
royal family.</p>

<p>When the procession came at last, wave after
wave of cheering swept along the crowds. From
her place in a coach, Nan looked out on a merry
happy throng, for the king was well beloved by
his people.</p>

<p>Nan, with others who were to surround the
royal family in its moment of triumph, was ushered
through a side door of the Cathedral and
taken to her place under the great pointed arches.
Here, in this church, every English sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
since the beginning of England&rsquo;s history had received
his crown, and here, now amid the tombs
of kings and queens and the distinguished dead of
all ages, a new king and queen were to take their
vows.</p>

<p>These things ran through Nan&rsquo;s mind as she
glanced about the Cathedral and tried to locate
her friends. Was that Bess that she saw in a gallery
high above her? And that Walter sitting next
to her? Nan puckered her brows and looked
again. Yes, it was, and she had no more than
found them, when the deep tones of the great
cathedral organ spread out through the church.
The Westminster choir joined in singing, &ldquo;I was
glad when they said unto me, we will go into the
House of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, the king and queen entered, walking
slowly and solemnly down the long coronation
carpet to the altar where they stopped and knelt.</p>

<p>During the service that followed, so solemn and
serious that many in the church were crying, Nan,
for the first time began to realize what a great
honor had been bestowed upon her in allowing
her to be present. She felt humble and insignificant
as the ceremony proceeded from one climax
to another.</p>

<p>When the Archbishop of Canterbury finally
placed the crown on the king&rsquo;s head and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
&ldquo;God crown you with a crown of glory and righteousness,&rdquo;
no other sound could be heard under
the great vaulted arches. Then, as he finished his
words, drums and trumpets broke into a clamor
and the shout of &ldquo;God Save the King!&rdquo; rang
through the Abbey, from floor to roof, while far
away outside, guns announced to the waiting
throngs that a new king had been crowned.</p>

<p>The peers put on their coronets. In the same
manner as the king, the queen was crowned. The
peeresses put on their coronets.</p>

<p>When it was all over, a procession formed and
passed, under the slanting rays of light that came
through the big rose windows, to the wide open
doors and then out, where all London waited to
sing and shout, &ldquo;May the King live forever! Long
live the King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget it,&rdquo; Nan said to her friends,
her Lakeview Hall friends and Jeanie, Hetty, and
Maureen at the tea that followed. It was the tea
that had been planned so long before on the boat,
and was given now by Hetty&rsquo;s grandmother in
honor of Nan so that all might hear of the wonderful
things that had been happening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor will we,&rdquo; her friends echoed, for each
had seen something special in the coronation.</p>

<p>So we will leave them, comparing notes on the
biggest event of their summer holidays. As we go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
out, it&rsquo;s Hetty who turns to Maureen and reminds
her, &ldquo;Remember, grandmother said on the boat
that you never can tell what&rsquo;s going to happen to
the likes of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maureen nods her head, and Hetty adds as we
close the door, &ldquo;What happened to Nan proves
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can hear them talking about it now and
agreeing. You&rsquo;ll agree too, if you read of their further
adventures in the next exciting volume in the
series, &ldquo;Nan Sherwood on the Mexican Border.&rdquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
